It's time for me to go to bed.
Muiriel is 20 now.
I am speechless.
I just don't know what to say.
I can't live like this.
No, not me, but you!
Then there is a problem...
So?
How many close friends do you have?
That's true.
One can always find time.
I can't tell her now. It's not that simple anymore.
I didn't like it.
There's a problem there that you don't see.
There are many words that I don't understand.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.
What's the problem?
I can only wait.
I don't like you anymore.
I don't want to wait so long.
Tomorrow, he will land on the moon.
Nobody understands me.
I like it very much.
What country are you from?
You think too much.
I saw her five days ago, he said.
He was known to everybody in the village.
Do you know who she is?
Aha! they would say.
It's been snowing.
Bill is two years older than I am.
Here we are.
Bob is my friend.
Good question.
Enter!
He never lies.
Bill has many friends.
He is three years my senior.
Both sisters are very beautiful.
I helped my father yesterday.
I don't know what this is.
What does one call you?
What's his name?
What's your name?
My name is Tamako, and yours is?
In what year were you born?
I asked him his name.
I booked a seat.
He dwells in the country.
I helped him yesterday.
Nobody goes outside in this kind of weather.
I never want to see you again.
Walk more slowly.
He's intelligent.
It is seven in London now.
What's the weather like there?
I have lived here since 1990.
He is seeking a job.
He asked me what my name was.
He said, "I'm from Canada."
We were younger then.
When did you begin learning German?
That's exactly what he said.
Have you got a headache?
It's so easy when you know the rules.
My husband is a very good cook.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
He doesn't like coffee.
I'm glad to see you again.
We have several bags here.
I have little money now.
We've been having good weather.
Of course you can.
John cannot be living in London now.
Kyoto is not as large as Osaka.
I've never seen him wearing jeans.
I saw Shin'ichi in Kakogawa yesterday.
Do you remember his name?
He has a brother who lives in Tokyo.
I know she's pretty.
I know everything.
Do you have time on Tuesday?
The Netherlands is a small country.
Holland is a small country.
I don't know how to interpret his words.
Oh, yes, I remember.
I know them.
Do you happen to know where she lives?
Where was he born?
He not only does not work but will not find a job.
She's five.
Just a minute.
I usually go home at four.
How long has Ken lived in Kobe?
And now?
Too much money?
When are you walking home?
Sometimes I go, sometimes I don't.
She likes Russian Pop.
He knows a lot about animals.
Some people are good, some people are bad.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
For me, this is not a problem.
For me, that is not a problem.
December is the last month of the year.
I like math.
Alexander is not younger than Vladimir.
What's for dinner tonight?
Are you free tonight?
Everyone knows it.
There is a metro in Kazan.
South Africa is far away.
She was talking all the time.
And then?
How pretty your sister is!
Almost no one thinks that we are sisters.
You've got another four day's journey before you reach Moscow.
He looked for them for five hours.
He got off at the next station.
Please don't speak so fast.
How's the weather there?
You're now free to go.
It is Monday.
The child bothered him with questions.
My brother speaks very quickly.
Ken was looking for you.
Everyone loves him.
I can't say.
Why me?
What did he say?
Why not?
What did you say?
Why is he here?
We have two kids.
I don't have time for reading.
She doesn't have many friends or girlfriends.
It's raining.
I've got a question.
Do you want to tell me something?
Please say ‘yes’!
Tomorrow's Sunday.
No problem at all!
I don't remember!
Do you have any drinks?
What's the weather like?
You know who she is?
Oh right, I have something tomorrow.
What're you looking at?
I live in a city.
Whatcha making?
What are you preparing?
What are you cooking?
I want to see her very much.
Some are red and others are white.
There's no point in waiting.
Can I drink alcohol?
He is her friend.
His son is eight years old.
Do you think I should write?
I liked Tony.
If you say, "I love you," then I will also say that to you.
I don't know you.
She spoke to me in a whisper.
Why don't you study French?
I've been working all day.
I was tired of the work.
My dad's free on Saturday.
I don't know.
We love her, and she loves us, too.
How beautiful she is!
As it is, I am awake.
The words poison and potion are cognates.
Her father is a policeman.
There is a lot of money.
He is well paid.
That's his house.
I don't remember where I bought it.
Little money, few friends.
He spoke very loudly.
Hi, Tom.
Cold water, please.
I like none of them.
Is she here yet?
What a business it is!
Where do you come from?
I have a brother and a sister. My brother lives in Tokyo and my sister lives in Nagano.
Tomorrow is Mother's Day.
She is all in all to him.
Go straight, and you will find the station.
The reporter shot questions at the politician.
My father does not go to Tokyo today.
I hear you, but I don't see you.
She likes wine.
We talked about many things.
His house is somewhere around here.
Yes, certainly.
Someone entered the room.
I have a friend living in London.
I dislike cold weather.
I bought a watch the other day. It keeps good time.
He no longer works here.
It was raining yesterday.
I can wait no longer.
What time did you eat?
He told me that he was very tired then.
How do you view this matter?
Don't look into my room.
I've worked all day, so that I am very tired.
My cousin is a little older than I.
Saturday is the day when he is free.
The point is that they are hungry.
He left just now.
Is this the right way to the station?
He drinks to excess.
What time do you go to work?
She couldn't look me straight in the face.
To begin with, we have no money now.
Are there taxis around here?
This is the town where he was born.
He's always been living in Tokyo.
Who was the last to reach the goal?
Like father, like son.
Do you have much money with you?
I don't know what to say.
I've got a headache.
Why didn't you come?
Why didn't you come?
But she liked children and she enjoyed her work.
We were just talking about you.
She stood waiting for me for a long time.
Are you going to go to Tokyo tomorrow?
Tony did not know their names.
I know some of the boys.
I have seen that face somewhere before.
He is always looking to the future.
Our food is cheap.
Thus spoke Zarathustra.
The pie is delicious.
Oh the times! Oh the customs!
She is far from beautiful.
I'm sleepy.
Hurry. Please lend me a hand.
I can only tell you what I know.
She was cooking dinner at that time.
He works in a bank.
I will tell the woman what I know.
Happy New Year!
You want to work at METRO?!
That's the spirit.
I like her.
How do you know each other?
It's food.
That's a bad day for me.
He is always with me.
It is I that am bad.
You know what it is.
Hello, how's business?
She doesn't like people who aren't punctual.
You know, you have beautiful eyes.
Do you know what she said?
I don't know what time it is.
That's how I got to know her.
He left the room.
They arrived in America a few days ago.
He set the box down on the table.
I like English, but I cannot speak well.
The more, the better.
Taro's and Hanako's desk is small.
How fast Tom speaks!
That's what I said all along.
My brother lives in Tokyo.
Tell me where she lives.
Work is all in all to me.
I am his junior by three years.
Rubén is the father of three children.
How she talks!
She has good footwork.
How much more time before dinner?
Do you drink?
I'm happy to see you here.
What is over there?
The sun has set.
Here we are!
I'm clever.
She slept more than ten hours yesterday.
He is intelligent.
She is very clever.
It is a short drive to the park.
I call him Mike.
I don't like cheese very much.
Mayuko came out of the room.
You're very beautiful.
He did not work on Sunday night.
Have you known him for a long time?
We got on the bus at Shinjuku.
I do not have much money on hand.
I know her.
I have leg cramps.
It isn't as cold here as in Alaska.
It began to snow.
He was too tired to walk any farther.
I talked to friends.
I sometimes see him on the street.
There! She comes!
You may as well say so.
How long will we have to wait?
I love you more than I love her.
He bought her a dog.
He has a lot of money.
It's already ten o'clock at night.
Where will you be this time tomorrow?
Everybody speaks well of him.
He gives me the creeps.
What a big house you have!
Just run down to the post office, won't you?
I can't eat or drink very hot things.
She rubbed her eyes.
I am now in an old castle.
Nobody can help me.
My eyes hurt.
He found a good place for me.
We have little snow here even in the winter.
Do you know where it is?
The trouble with our times is that the future is not what it used to be.
And I'm in Lvov now!
She works at the bank.
We are his sons.
I know him.
Hey Susan, how are things?
I work in Milan.
Do you remember?
I am very pleased to see you again.
Hi! Do you work here?
This is the place where she works as a secretary.
Ken is older than Seiko.
Hi, how do you do?
Hello, Chicago!
Hey.
Hello, John! How are you?
Hello, I am Nancy.
It's too far.
What do you think about him?
You can go.
What's the meaning of this?
I remember him well.
I haven't got much money.
This plane is his.
Oh, no, of course!
I'm working in Tokyo now.
We cannot tell which is better.
I'm hungry.
He has been in Hokkaido before.
I feel a pain here.
Meg talks too much.

She's two years older than you.
It's time to get to work.
Why didn't you come?
He came back home three days later.
Oh, no, of course!
Kiev is the mother of Russian cities.
We were all scared shitless.
Don't say that.
Why did you come early?
I want you too badly.
He is not as intelligent as his older brother.
He didn't know that.
What did you say your name was?
I just don't know what to say.
He lives some where about the park.
Sometimes, I don't understand him.
It's snowy today.
I don't want to see anyone today.
It's Saturday.
I'm not free today.
Will it rain today?
Everybody loves her.
Say it in another way.
You can't say no.
I was born in America.
He is not as smart as his older brother.
Of course, he is right.
We are his children.
No problem.
They say that he has a lot of old money.
How's the family?
He's not first but second.
Which animal is small?
What car do you like more?
What does this word mean?
Do you remember me?
Wow!
Did you know him?
It's better.
She does not like snakes and mathematics.
Shall we start?
We have a black and white dog.
Is he by the car? "No, he is in the car."
I usually sleep at nine.
Bill has a lot of friends.
Do you have any sisters?
Do you have any sisters?
Canada is larger than Japan.
How is everybody doing?
It is not proper that you talk that way.
He fixed his eyes on her.
I have some money.
You know something?
Drive slowly.
Drive slowly.
How are you getting along with your study?
I was born to love you.
Were you tired last night?
They say that Venice is a beautiful city.
What have you been up to?
You're working too hard.
He's so much of a faggot.
I have a little money with me.
Love me, love my dog.
We walked more quickly than usual.
I like everything that comes with summer.
He said he would come and he did come.
It is time to go.
It's you I'll always love.
How deep?
It's not a cat. It's a dog.
Hello, Meg, how are things?
This is my question.
What is the time?
Betty speaks Esperanto very well.
The mathematics class is good.
Speak slower, please.
I've got no friends.
What's your problem?

I can read without glasses.
I did not know that she has a child.
My father has just come home.
I'm sorry, but I can't hear you well.
How much money do you have with you?
He is very good-looking.
I don't like that either.
I think about you all the time.
We will purchase a new car next week.
I'm thinking of you.
She prefers beer to wine.
There are a lot of children in the park.
I lived in Japan three years ago.
What's the weather like today?
Please tell me where you will live.
What time is it now? "It's 10 o'clock."
Does it hurt when you chew?
I have some American friends.
As you already know.
This is what I bought in Spain.
I am pleased to see you again.
There are desks in the room.
He is no longer here.
And the tea isn't good either.
I saw him three years ago.
I like none of them.
I know where she is.
How big he is!
They say that he will never return.
Where's the emergency exit?
These days few people suffer from tuberculosis.
I'm simply looking.
What is he talking about?
They looked everywhere for him, but couldn't find him anywhere.
I don't know him.
Do you have something to say?
How old is he?
I do not love him anymore.
Take it easy.
I was just thinking of a new job.
He's started looking for a job.
Do you like it?
This is all the money I have now.
It's time for us to get going.
Walk as fast as possible.
She is eight.
What did your father teach you?
Where do you live now?
Happy to see you.
I've got two brothers.
I've got no money.
It should be like this.
Here's the house where he lived.
But he slept like a baby.
He bought a new car.

You don't know me.
His sisters are both beautiful.

He lives there alone.
Everyone is waiting for you.
You're so beautiful.
How have you been recently?
I saw him.
I will be there tomorrow.
But I don't have any money.
I'm sorry, I don't think I'll be able to.
Where was Tom born?
He is almost always home.
So that's how it is!

Look, he's coming.
He's smarter than them.
He was born in Africa.
My house is in a village.

I know only this.
What do you want to say?
He's studying Chinese.

I'm calling her, but she's not coming.
I'm already ready.
Tom's older than me.
In one night, Dima added.
Do you like rain?
I don't know where she lives.
Shishir is following me.
Beware of the dog!
Cover your eyes.

The richer the city, the more rubbish it generates.
Louder please, I cannot hear well.
And now?
I was born in 1979.
I think so too.
I've seen the dog.
It is already nine o'clock.
Is there anything wrong?
He thinks only of making money.
I don't want to work.
Are you sleeping?
Are you going to sleep?
I'm always hungry.
It's none of his business.
I've got a big problem.
1980 was the year when I was born.
I read.
This is the house where he lives.
Here and now.
What did you say?
I am thirsty.
I've got a lot of friends.
What are you reading?

When it rains, she takes the bus.
It rained.
It hardly ever rains there.
Where is the rain?
Good. And you?
I know both of them.
He thinks he knows everything.
Leave the room.
When do you work?
Do I know him?

Excuse me?
He is an old friend of mine.

He's not one of us.
This coffee is cold.
She has large blue eyes.
Where do you work?
I don't know her.
Is it a cat or a dog?
I don't have any money on me.
He is better off than he was.
Which one is mine?
You've never been to Paris?
The sun came out.
I'd rather not eat that.

I waited and waited.
That's a tough question.
How do you say...?
I like dogs a lot.
Better late than never.
What country are you from?
We're old friends.
Any questions?
I'm free.
Are you free tonight?
I was looking for you.
He's very angry with you.
I don't see him.
It's more difficult than you think.
Hi. How are you?
I am older than him.
I've got a question.
I was looking at her.
What don't you like?
Even we are people.
I'm cooking now.
My head doesn't ache anymore.
No one thinks so.

I wash my hands.
My brother's in Australia now.
I know you.
He will not say yes.
Last night we worked until 10 p.m.
Are you going with us?
I should head out.
Who doesn't love her?
Could we have a table outside?
He can say such things.

Go right ahead.
Keep going straight.
I don't like him.
I've never seen such a big dog.
This is a dog.
Why does everybody love cats?
I don't know what to think anymore.
She has many friends in Hong Kong.
Sunday is the last day of the week.
Are you looking for me?
We had a rough time.
You're retarded, or something?!
All of us know him well.
Here he comes.
You are so smart!
Did you find what you were looking for?
She knows that you know.
What do you know about him?
She is no longer what she used to be.
How could you say something like that?
Where have you been all this time?
One of these days is none of these days.
No, I don't think so.
My brother works in a bank.
Should I tell him?
He is not here.
We don't have the time.
One man, no man.
It's a brand new day.
She fooled him.
Nobody can stop me!
Tom isn't drinking.
Other times, other manners.
Why are you still here?
Where is his house?
Where is her house?
Seek, and you will find.
I don't know what to think.
No, I didn't go out.
You go first.
Paris fell in 1940.
Forgive me, please, I meant well.
I am young.
He can't have been ill.
I can't see well.
That's why you're the best.
He lived in Iceland very long.
There is something about him I don't like.
I'm old.
See it's simple, either I am right or you are wrong.
Do you have friends on Tatoeba?
He came into my room.
I can't find him anywhere.
The United States is a large country.
They see Dan.
These two have very little in common.
I would rather have a coffee.
My son lives in a distant place.
Here's $10.00.
I had my watch stolen yesterday.
I don't like Alice.
I can't speak that fast.
Have you ever been there?
Have you ever been there?
What did you say yesterday?
What did you say yesterday?
What did you say yesterday?
What did you say yesterday?
I can't tell you how I love you.
It's not a road, but a path.
He didn't say in which year he was born.
We got into the car.
He is better than me.
Why do you know that?
Tom wants to see you.
They started at the same time.
I saw him go out.
The fact is that I have no money with me.
It's too loud.
Tom is sleeping.
I have no family.
Someone's in the house.
Do you like me, too?
Is that seat free?
It is raining all the time.
That's not what I meant to say.
I'm not a child anymore.
Any child knows it.
I am coming.
The room is covered with dust.
Do you like rap?
Do you like rap?
She has three brothers.
He's somewhere in the park.
I've worked here for ten years.
I'll give her some flowers.
Hello, old friend!
Hello, old friend!
He is like a father to me.
What do you think of Japan?
She stood on her head.
Where's my father?
Where's my father?
I won't tell a soul.
I'm here already!
We didn't see her anywhere.
We didn't see him anywhere.
I waited for ten minutes.
How many days comprise a leap year?
I don't like dogs.
There is someone here.
She said that.
I'm waiting for her.
I will be in London by this time tomorrow.
He doesn't like us.
Time cannot be stopped.
Do we know each other?
She isn't at home now.
You work too much.
He doesn't have any friends.
I know!
I thought Tom was sleeping.
He can't walk any more.
Do you like it?
I am good friends with Bill.
I had never seen her.
Where can I find it?
One's as bad as the other.
Tom is always in a hurry.
He is the last man I want to see.
What foods do you avoid eating?
I cannot help thinking about him.
She's still young.
She's still young.
Nobody lives with me.
My mother isn't at home.
I washed the car.
I don't even know him.
She is five years junior to me.
This is your dog.
He is called Jeff by everyone.
Which do you like better, Denver or Montreal?
English is not easy for us.
Can we say "No" to America?
I have no money today.
Where are the parents?
Are you looking for somebody?
Are you looking for somebody?
He has a dog.
Where are the parents?
No one is in the room.
Where did you find that?
The sooner, the better.
I am always ready to help you.
Today is Saturday and tomorrow is Sunday.
He has a headache.
Are you waiting for the bus?
I don't know what it means.
This is Mary's dog.
You are expecting too much of her.
I've never loved you.
I have never loved you.
I've never loved you.
I have never loved you.
My father isn't home.
Mayuko entered the room.
It began snowing just now.
She is five years younger than me.
I entered a coffee shop.
We've got a lot of friends.
The soup is too salty.
I can't drink any more beer.
Does it hurt?
She has beautiful eyes.
He's too old.
Which is mine?
This is even worse!
Where shall I wait for you?
I saw her again.
This is my house.
Yumi has much money now.
I don't have four sisters.
It's already time to go to sleep.
Both girls have blue eyes.
What's wrong with this?
All of us want to live as long as possible.
This is for you!
You remember it better than I do.
I'm free on Sunday.
I'm free on Sunday.
Hi, my name is Omid.
What if he's wrong?
We're almost like brothers.
Please don't speak so fast.
Where is the cat?
Alice didn't see the dog.
Are you ten?
You can never plan the future by the past.
How can you not like him?
Some are expensive, and others are very cheap.
I like it more and more.
He's already sleeping.
They avoided each other for days.
Are you drinking green tea?
I am more beautiful than you.
I've got a problem.
I bought a dog for him.
We depend on you.
She is not here.
He lives close by.
It's Thursday.
Do you know that?
How fast Tom speaks!
I'm going with you.
She wants to live in the city.
Do you want to go first?
Don't run across the street.
Why aren't you coming with us?
What's wrong with him?
John is clever.
The problem is not what he said, but how he said it.
Can you speak Toki Pona?
I'm not young anymore.
I have a big family.
Do you like to cook?
He and I are friends.
The weather is better today than yesterday.
I want to live in the city.
What is it you like about me?
Do you like Moscow?
Do you see the father and the mother?
How did you get into my house?
Just be quiet.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Why do you say that?
I don't know her, nor do I want to.
I don't have as much money as you think I do.
When did you buy it?
I don't wait for anybody.
I have a dog.
Whoever loves me, also loves my dog.
I never saw him again.
You can't teach your grandmother to suck eggs.
Don't say such a thing again.
I'm free!
I'm free!
Time and tide wait for no man.
Don't walk so fast.
Tom could've helped me, but he didn't.
Do you have time?
I was born in 1988.
I have three times more money than you do.
He lives alone.
What time do we leave tomorrow?
No one knows why.
I've never been to Argentina.
This is the last time.
Noriko is like her mother.
You can leave now.
You're always saying that.
You know where Tom is.
It is cold all year here.
This is my husband.
Tell me what your name is.
Tell me your names.
She said that she would help me.
He is the baby of the family.
You don't... you don't talk to me like that.
He is my old friend.
Do you know what this means?
Big Brother is watching you.
She never told me she had a cat.
What's the matter with him?
She knew something was wrong.
Tom came out of the room.
He is not a friend, but an acquaintance.
I don't have a brother.
My son can count up to a hundred now.
He always leaves home at seven.
Where's my brother?
I've said everything.
I think it's OK.
I'm still a little hungry.
What's gone wrong?
I like you very much!
Everybody loves her.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
We live close to the station.
He asked me who I was.
It's not you, it's me!
I like coffee better.
That's all I can say at the moment.
In Canada we sleep in a bed, not on the floor.
You're on to something.
We'll be friends.
She has a big family.
Oh please, not so fast.
I can't stand him.
I wanted to say yes.
He is not more than two or three years younger than I am.
She knows that John loved her.
She is no longer welcome here.
She has something in her hand.
I need to go home.
Tom doesn't remember my name.
The baby is still sleeping.
I was born in the winter.
We don't have that in Europe.
She has a lot of friends here.
What's that in your hand?
She told me she loved me.
Dinner is ready, Father.
Sunday is the first day of the week.
It is just five o'clock.
Where are they from?
I have little time to read.
Nobody likes it.
Nobody likes it.
Please forgive me for not having written for a long time.
She bought a new car.
Green suits you very well.
I'm not a baby, you know!
I like sleeping.
I rescued him.
You're not my friend anymore.
Go home.
How did you get to know her?
My brother is eight years older than me.
She likes to read.
Does she have a hobby?
I know that she knows.
I do not have much time.
He is younger than me by three years.
I don't know if today is Tuesday or Wednesday.
I know where she lives.
I'm handsome.
I'm beautiful.
It is seven now.
I don't have many friends.
Find a job.
I just saw him.
I bought her a clock.
I bought her a clock.
Although it was raining, I went out.
Does he like Japan?
How beautiful you are today!
My brother works in France.
We don't get on well with each other.
There's hella empty seats over there.
Africa is not a country.
I believe I have now told you everything.
He was born in Athens in 1956.
His parents loved me.
Where do you see him?
Where do you see him?
Daddy, buy me a vuvuzela!
The more money we have, the more we want.
As for dogs, I like them.
She thinks that she's always right.
We all got in the car.
I think we're all a bit cuckoo.
Come outside.
She knew that John loved her.
Is this the bus to Oxford?
Tom can't find Mary.
Tom reads slowly.
What does the word "next" means?
I told her that she was right.
I was born in Tokyo in 1968.
It goes without saying that he's a clever man.
Hello, what is your name?
That isn't said anymore.
It's your turn.
I'm waiting for a call.
Does Tom know who I am?
I know what you are thinking.
I know what you are thinking.
I work with him.
I work with him.
Are we friends?
How can I help?
Is it far away?
Drive on.
I know you don't like me.
He is two years older than Ogawa.
How much money do you have?
He's three years older than her.
I don't like bad boys.
I'm gonna call the police!
Do you have a crush on her?
I slept very well last night.
It could cost you your head.
She told me everything.
We saw her.
She came into the room.
I am going to Hokkaido in the summer.
Do you like to cook?
My house is very cold.
She knows ten times as many English words as I do.
I'm on my way to work.
I can't see you.
I can't see you.
I'm bad.
Is she sleeping?
Is today Friday?
It's a fine day.
It's dirty work.
I'm hungry and thirsty.
Are we only friends?
You're tired of not doing anything.
You are tired from doing nothing.
You are tired from doing nothing.
You work too hard these days. Aren't you tired?
It can't wait.
What did he see?
You can say whatever you want.
You can say whatever you want.
What do you want to say to Tom?
What do you want to say to Tom?
I have brothers.
I think you're ready.
We've been talking about you.
How would you like it?
How would you like it?
What's the word?
We must keep in touch with the times.
Where am I now?
Where am I now?
We don't have a lot in common.
You can go home.
I haven't many brothers.
I can't tell you yet.
Have you seen this?
Have you seen this?
Have you seen this?
Did you see her?
Did you see her?
Did you see her?
When do you drink coffee?
Why are your eyes so big?
I have no further questions.
I've seen everything.
I've seen everything.
I saw everything.
I saw everything.
I live in Tahiti.
If you don't understand, ask.
She has such beautiful eyes.
You'd better not see her now.
He is less intelligent than me.
You have three cars.
You have three cars.
She is two years older than you.
I saw him in the park.
Excuse me, is this seat taken?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Which house do you live in?
Tell that person where my house is.
You helped Mommy?
It's six o'clock already.
I like snow. It's so beautiful!
He was born in Osaka.
Their feet are dirty.
Somebody's coming.
Stand up straight.
Stand up straight.
He doesn't drink.
What did they say?
What did Tom know?
I can't tell you that.
I've never seen that before.
I don't understand him.
Do you have a child?
Do you have a child?
I've gotta go.
She's so young.
Tell her which one to take.
I've been here for a while.
Do you know her?
I don't want to look.
I think we have to go.
I think Tom is lying.
Do you not know who I am?
Don't you know who I am?
Do you have a family?
Do you have a family?
I know where he lives.
How glad I am!
How glad I am!
She's looking at you.
She's looking at you.
Don't look at me like that.
I don't know when he'll come back.
We have lots of snow in the winter.
We know that she lives in the city.
You know the rest of the story.
You know the rest of the story.
I thought I was alone here.
I thought I was alone here.
Tom needs a haircut.
I know you have a girlfriend.
I have little money.
My father loves us.
I was born in Kyoto.
Why does Tom drink so much?
She was so tired that she couldn't walk.
You're young.
You're young.
You're young.
Everybody says that.
We spoke yesterday.
We've been friends.
I'm in Hong Kong right now.
He's waiting for you at home.
He has large blue eyes.
There are many parks in our town.
Not now!
He said he had been to Hawaii before.
You are his brother, right?
What is her problem?
You still haven't told me who he is.
It's still raining.
What do you see in him?
What do you see in her?
I am young.
No means no.
He slept in the car.
Is it your car?
A kiss without a mustache is like a bowl of soup with no salt.
Wednesday is a little Friday.
I helped him yesterday.
What is Tom reading?
He's already here.
What's wrong with them?
I never saw you.
I never saw you.
I couldn't say no.
I will have to help them.
Are you going, too?
Are you free on Wednesday?
Why isn't it working?
Why isn't it working?
Why isn't it working?
Does he like China?
She is less beautiful than her sister is.
From where?
Do you know what time it is?
Did someone say something?
Is there something wrong with that?
Speak softly.
How long did they live in England?
No problem, I understand.
It's cold there even in the summer.
What're you staring at?
I didn't see you.
I feel better.
What is this?
He came into the room.
She told me that he loves me.
He told me that she loves me.
Tom is too young.
This is our friend Tom.
He knows everything.
In what month were you born?
She talked a lot.
What's for supper?
My father is home.
I know what's wrong.
I know Tom says he doesn't like me.
I think we're too young.
I'll start this evening.
Don't teach me how to live!
He isn't hungry.
She is nice.
Your cat is cute.
What is the matter with you?
Can you speak either Chinese or Russian?
She bought him a ticket.
It always snows here in winter.
I usually work from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., but today I worked until 10:00 p.m.
When did you see him?
That will be all for today.
Tell me where Tom is.
He is still too young for the job.
We expect a lot from him.
There is something about him I don't like.
His car is two years old.
Do you have time on today?
I'm not your husband anymore.
Something's wrong with him.
Nothing can stop me.
You can go home now.
Why aren't you looking for a job?
If you like.
I thought you were my friend.
She lived there for many years.
I will never tell!
Nobody's looking for us.
Where's my son?
Yes, I lived there for many years.
We have a cat. We all love cats.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday are the seven days of the week.
Are you free on Tuesday?
You have to leave home at six.
You like her, don't you?
You like him, don't you?
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know what to tell you.
When do you mean to start?
Tom is too far away.
Tom helped us a lot.
That's our problem.
Stop the car.
He is a man of his word.
He has already gone out.
That's a lot!
Monday is the first day, Tuesday is the second day, and so on.
We still have time.
Even with his glasses, he doesn't see very well.
His family loved me.
I bought it last week.
Sorry, I don't follow.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
Is this where you live?
You are a good man.
He's too old for me.
I'm too tired to think.
The dog is beautiful.
How boring!
He left the house at eight o'clock.
I don't know how old Tom is.
I don't like this place.
I don't want to go with you.
I don't want to go with you.
She was aching all over.
My arm hurts.
My father is very angry with me.
Things are not that simple.
You still haven't told me who he is.
Sometimes everything goes wrong.
Tom's eating.
I'm glad to see you.
They don't want you to know.
Do you enjoy living like that?
I didn't want to be seen.
Is that a bus or car?
Do you think that we'll find her house?
It's outdated.
I've been waiting for you.
What are they looking for?
The longer I stayed in Paris, the more I liked it.
I am sorry I did not write to you for such a long time.
Since it rained, I did not go.
I am going to work.
I did not think that he would help us.
I did not live in Sanda last year.
I didn't sleep well last night.
I thought Tom was asleep.
We see with our eyes.
It's hard to say.
I think it's time for me to get a job.
What does she see?
He is handsome and clever.
The children are already tired.
Nobody wants to look for my car.
I don't like the way he speaks.
Does Tom know?
Is it the last lesson?
Do you feel better today?
If you are tired, go to bed.
Where do you live if you have no home?
Where do you live if you have no home?
They became man and wife.
I'll be very happy if I can serve you.
I'm sorry, I just wanted to help.
Tell us how we may help you.
Tell us how we may help you.
It is a beautiful city.
But why?
I'm the only one who knows them.
Are you going by bus or car?
I'll rip your head off!
He's still at work.
I don't like big dogs.
He knew it all along.
Tell me where Tom is.
Are you going home?
I say that all the time.
Lubomir loves his mom.
It's already 7:00.
I don't love her, not even if she loves me.
Those were his last words.
He's my brother.
The city is beautiful.
One is red and the other is white.
She can't stop them.
Ann doesn't have a sister.
Whom did you see?
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
This is the village where he was born.
You helped Mommy?
Stop him!
Stop him!
Is your wife still in America?
I don't know which is which.
I don't know which is which.
I have several good friends.
Are you pleased with your new job?
Let's go to the club.
She's six years older than I am.
Are you mentally ill?
What do I care?
What do I care?
Hello, I'm Mike.
I don't have any close friends.
I have a question I want to ask you.
He found me a good job.
I have never dared to speak to her.
She's two years older than me.
I don't like snow.
He has a ticket.
Why do you have so many cats?
He has a dog and six cats.
The rain lasted three days.
You can't unring a bell.
It snows in Paris.
Did she say it?
Where are you living now?
It's not as cold today as it was yesterday.
He wrote to me from time to time.
I've been waiting for you for three hours!
Are there still some empty seats?
I only saw her once.
They are our cars.
My son came to my room.
His father is a physicist.
Is there something you wanted to say?
There are many factors.
Do you know how many cats she has?
He said yes.
No one saw me.
I want a new car.
I'm still in love with him.
He loves her.
I saw her a week ago.
The cat is waiting for you at home.
The cat is waiting for you at home.
It's for you.
It's for you.
Is anybody in there?
Read.
John is two years older than I am.
Do they love each other?
What about next Sunday?
Tom works more diligently now.
I think there's something wrong with you.
It serves you right.
If not now, when?
He is my brother, not father.
Tom doesn't want to live like that.
Everyone loves that place.
We have been to Tokyo many times.
We have eaten there three times.
I don't have a dog.
I have a lot of flowers. Some are red and some are yellow.
Did Tom tell you who his wife is?
They are still looking for the child.
Have you already booked our seats on a plane?
We do not have snow here.
The dog wants to go outside.
He left the room as soon as I entered it.
Our time is limited.
Help me find an empty room for myself.
Where are all the others?
It is a long way to the village.
I am no match for him.
I saw him again.
How many sisters do you have?
Why I am not living with you?
I last saw him in the car park.
You can't help them.
That's what I'm looking for.
What came over you?
He lives with his parents.
I'm waiting for my mother.
I shared a room with him.
He still remembers you.
But where are we?
What kind of job are you looking for?
What kind of job are you looking for?
How long have you been living in Tokyo?
How long have you been living in Tokyo?
His relatives began to keep away from him.
I thought that he knew everything about Japan.
He works at night.
He works at night.
We know that she was born in Canada.
What do you think?
What do you think?
He doesn't have a sister.
A dog is a clever animal.
Let me say one thing.
I'm three years younger than you.
I'm three years younger than you.
It rained for days.
The weather today is worse than yesterday.
No one can tell what'll happen in the future.
I don't like to cook when it's hot outside.
I looked for you everywhere and didn't find you.
This doesn't work!
Where is the woman?
I don't want to go to work today.
I'm a married woman.
It's getting dark outside.
I'm free now.
This is nothing more than xenophobia.
What the fuck?
She is well paid.
Do a lot of people live in your town?
This is too easy for him.
I don't understand them.
Did you work yesterday?
He had a crush on her.
Where can I buy tickets?
He's standing on his head.
See you tomorrow.
We have a cat and a dog.
Such a method is out of date.
He knows us very well.
She has a son everybody loves.
Tom knows that he's right.
It's my first time.
This is normal.
You love us.
I'm now very tired.
Do you remember us?
I haven't seen him for years.
I have a friend.
I think that he is too young.
We're just like brothers.
If you are wrong, then so am I.
Two roundtrip tickets to Osaka, please.
I'm the youngest child in the family.
I'm two years younger than he is.
Does it snow a lot in the winter?
I study math harder than English.
She's two years older than he.
How old do you think Tom is?
I think there's something we're overlooking.
This is smaller than that.
Let's go to sleep.
Am I alone here?
I work faster alone.
Are you still alone?
All we can do is wait for him.
They understand each other.
Can Tom help us?
No one knew who I was.
I saw her last week.
There is a woman who wants to see you.
You are handsome.
Tom can't see you.
Don't look at her!
I entered her room.
Tom has been sick for a very long time.
Does that mean we're in trouble?
Is there something you want to ask me?
They can't stop her.
Tell her that I am hungry.
Do you know him?
We took some booze and started the blah blah.
I like having lots of things to do.
I don't like it.
She loves to cook.
That's what I said to him.
Tom wants me to go with him.
I don't want to drink cold tea.
You and I are old friends.
Do you know his father?
How did you get in?
I don't want to see you here again.
Beyond that I cannot help you.
He likes me.
Did you have a good sleep last night?
I know his name.
You're not dogs.
Paul talks a lot.
Why do you like Hawaii?
What day is it today?
You were at home yesterday.
He can read well.
I thought I knew everything.
He's my friend. Do you know him?
I thought you were injured.
How's it going, Tom?
He's fit for the loony bin.
We were talking about you.
How come you aren't taking me?
It is snowing today.
What've you found?
I know his brother well.
He likes animals more than people.
I'll be with you forever.
Go ahead and tell him if you want to.
I've been waiting for you all day.
If that's so, all the better.
There's no coffee left.
The police are after him.
What is the next street after this?
You're not my father!
I have red eyes.
Time is money.
Time's on our side.

Do you still love him?
You don't have to go there.
The girl was looking at him too.
That's where I'll be.
I found a way out.
Don't say such a thing.
I'm glad to see you here.
Women's rights are human rights.
She is a well-mannered girl.
Today, everything went awry from the start.

I hear from her once in a while.
They were mostly women.
They're good people.
Hello. How can I help you?

As you say.
I guess you're right.
We're going the wrong way.

Have you told me everything?
I didn't have to wait long.
We've become good friends.
Dear brothers and sisters!
Don't ever speak to me like that!
It's even worse than I thought.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
What is that?
I already know.
Brazil is the land of the future.
Do you know who he is?
Pull over here.
How do you know?
What are your office hours?
She wanted him to say that he loved her.
Women are beautiful.

I'm only happy when Tom is here.
I'm not very hungry.
You work hard.
Were you looking at her legs?

How many more are there?
Now I understand.
I asked what was wrong.
I waited until the last minute.
What do you want me to tell you?
How do you know that it's his?
What does she keep as a pet?
You've been told.
I know that he's reading.
How come?
Don’t think of anything bad.
They'll never know we're here.
That's all I saw.
I see your point.
We didn't see anybody.
I love my mom.
I don't want to tell him.

Do you know his brother?

Do you remember seeing me before?
He talks a lot.
It is still colder today.
We saw them.
You aren't thinking.
You aren't thinking.
I thought you were Tom.
Tom was waiting.
We were waiting.
They waited.
She waited for the bus.
I think you're lying.
How are you? Good? Bad?
Do you see people in the park?
You're not my friend anymore.
You're not my friend anymore.
You're not my friend anymore.
They're still young.
You're still young.
I like it.
This is a girl I know well.
What if I say no?
What time is it now in San Francisco?
I don't know what it is, but it's something very big.
I believe Tom knows.
It's curtains for us.
You are what you read.
Couldn't you have told me about that yesterday?
Am I speaking too quickly?
Tom is angry at you.
Don't wait for me.
Aren't you hungry, Tom?
Now that's right.
I'm here to help you.
I'm here to help you.
I'll never understand you.
I'll never understand you.
She loves him.
I like the rain and the snow.
Did you go out last night?
This is the last one.
I thought you went home.
I thought you went home.
I thought you went home.
I don't know. What do you think?
I don't know. What do you think?
It's very cold now.
They're looking for you.
I don't know where Tom is.
I've seen you somewhere before.
She had a crush on him.
You're smart.
You're smart.
You're smart.
You're smart.
You're smart.
He stopped the car.
I’ve started learning Esperanto.
My hearing is bad.
He is like a father to me.
I saw Jessie standing there.
She was born in the 1950s.
Where's my other shoe?
We have a big dog.
She's smart and beautiful.
We didn't want to go, but we had to.
This is all the money I have.
I think it's time for me to go to bed.
I think it's time for me to go to bed.
There are a lot of girls in the room.
I can't hear you properly, please speak more slowly.
The faster, the better!
We have no water.
Give my best regards to your family.
Tom is now somewhere in Australia.
I like your car.
I don't want to see anyone today.
I don't have much time now.
Don't you like this?
Are you free tomorrow evening?
Why are the police here?
Don't you have any money?
My friend helped me.
I never looked for you.
Why do you want to know that?
In winter it snows.
Tom has started looking for a new job.
Hello, my friend! I haven't seen you for such a long time!
I have good hands.
Where were you born?
Some months have thirty days, others thirty one.
I can help them.
I know I'm rambling.
I'm not as young as I was.
I knew that.
I knew that.
Tom doesn't want to go alone.
Who bought it? "I bought it."
I know a person who speaks Russian very well.
If you help me learn English, I'll help you learn Japanese.
This isn't food.
I thought it went well.
Nobody wants to work.
Tom didn't see you.
Did you know him?
We like snow.
She saw everything.
He saw everything.
We live ten minutes away from him.
It's not so simple.
They were all hungry.
They knew each other.
That's all for today.
That's all for today.
What are your names?
I watch TV.
This is the watch that I bought yesterday.
I'm waiting for the ferry.
They're everywhere!
Tom was looking at you.
Tom worked really hard.
We have so little time.
Where are you from, Tom?
I'm waiting for a friend.
Since when has Marcus been living here?
Now it's time for you to go.
He now has the password.
How may we help?
Is he planning on helping us?
Whom are you looking for?
You're a beautiful girl.
Few townsmen know which sacred day is which.
This is the house I live in.
When can we start?
I'll wait here until she comes.
I do not know whether it is good or not.
I do not like mathematics very much.
You're not as clever as you think.
I need a lot of them.
He's too young to live by himself yet.
What time is it there now?
They say she's good at cooking.
I'm ready to leave.
The weather of Japan is hotter than England's.
I saw her with you.
We can go.
I don't drink alcohol.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
I don't even know where Tom lives.
The problem is we don't know who Tom is.
Some of them are clever.
Is there someone with you?
Is there someone with you?
I still think Tom is wrong.
Are you expecting somebody?
Are you expecting somebody?
Are you waiting for someone?
Are you waiting for someone?
Are you looking for somebody?
Are you looking for somebody?
Don't tell anyone that I told you.
Don't tell anyone that I told you.
I'll buy a new one.
This is my younger brother.
I'll find her.
We know why.
Did you say something? "No. Did you?"
Did you say something? "No. Did you?"
He didn't want to go to Japan.
I still think about her from time to time.
Echuk is looking for a job.
I don't have any Canadian friends.
I don't have time now.
Tom isn't like you.
I'm not finding the second sock.
I think they're honest people.
Where's the bus for the city?
Everybody knew that she spoke very good English.
Are you free tomorrow?
Are you free tomorrow?
I'm sorry, we have no vacancies.
How many times do I have to tell you that Tatoeba is not a human being?
I know you know.
When was the last time you saw the cat?
When will you be free?
When will you be free?
I'm a bad singer.
I like cats more than dogs.
We have a tea break at five o'clock.
I'll give it to you tomorrow.
Tom always sings out of tune.
Nobody cares what you think.
I purchased a new car last year.
Is that something new?
I think about her all the time.
She didn't even say thanks.
His son is serving his sentence.
You've gone too far.
He's on his way.
How did you know we were here?
Do you have any siblings?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
I don't know what to tell Tom.
I drink beer.
It's a minute to three o'clock.
You're too old for me.
You're too old for me.
You're too old for me.
You're too old for me.
I don't know how to buy a ticket.
I think you know who I'm talking about.
I think you know who I'm talking about.
I think you know who I'm talking about.
I think you know who I'm talking about.
I don't know any more than you do.
I don't know any more than you do.
Now it's four days to Saturday.
I remember it like today.
That's a faster way.
I don't know how else to say it.
I don't know how much time we have left.
I'm not like that.
I know who that is.
I just want to help you.
I just want to help you.
Go home!
Never speak to me again!
I don't have sons.
He is my friend whose name is Jack.
I can't keep my eyes off of it.
He's not a patch on him.
You are one of us.
You have a lovely home.
Why is Tom talking?
Why don't you go to sleep?
Why does Tom think that?
Why do you think we're here?
Why do you think Tom is here?
Why do people say that?
Why did Tom say yes?
Why are you out of breath?
Why are you out here?
Why are you out here?
Why are you going there?
Who's in there now?
Who's got the tickets?
Who says Tom knew?
What's that got to do with this?
What're you up to?
What do you think went wrong?
We're almost out of time.
What have you found, Tom?
What did they tell you?
I don't know how old Tom is.
There's something wrong with me.
There's something wrong with me.
There is something wrong with me.
There is something wrong with me.
Why the fuck do you live like this, Tom?
Why the fuck live like this, guys?
How is everything?
It's easier than you think.
You're prettier than me.
You're more beautiful than her.
I also like writing.
I'm making tea.
The baby's fine.
Cats are smart.
That's your opinion.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Have you found a job?
Have you found a job?
So that's Tatoeba.
He likes me and I like him too.
She likes me and I like her too.
If you have something to say, say it to my face.
Go when you want.
Why didn't you come earlier?
We sacrifice a lot.
I have questions.
What do you think, Tom?
I saw him with another woman.
She worked for several hours.
The father is very tired.
I expect him to help me.
I'm not angry at you.
We move as one.
You can sleep here if you want.
I am not your wife.
Here comes trouble.
This is their place.
Tom meant well.
Big Brother is watching you.
It's too long.
A woman's place is in the home.
It's so yummy.
My brother and I share the same room.
I do not feel like drinking beer tonight.
How much do you think Tom needs?
How much do you think Tom needs?
One eye sleeps, the other sees.
I think I know why.
I think you know why I'm calling you.
Tom was at a loss for words.
I don't want to live all by myself.
Everybody knows her.
They're all hungry.
Haven't you been to Tahiti?
> means greater than.
He shished, mished, farted, got out.
To live is good, but it's good to live even better!
Is there anything you want to tell us?
Is there anything you want to tell us?
I'm not telling you to go alone.
She's smarter than you think.
Could I have a word with you?
Tom is just a dick.
They're not here yet.
I thought it was forbidden.
What? What did you say?
You're who I need now.
I don't know why I'm scared.
How did you manage that?
Do you even care?
He said something.
She took my breath away.
You're much spoken about.
I've got a wife and children.
Say what you want.
What're you planning now?
I have got much homework.
Here's the house she used to live in.
I don't know why he said that to me.
Who did you say that to?
Who did you say that to?
My father is like a friend to me.
He's pig-headed.
My baby wants to talk.
Doesn't he live in Montmartre anymore?
Tom put some clothes on.
They were nose to nose.
I've been waiting for years.
Which street should we start with?
On which street should I start?
Tom never saw him again.
Rushia, do you have a sister?
We're going to the mall.
Which street should I start with?
She said something.
I said something.
I don't live in that city.
Tom is very hungry.
Tom knew everything.

I already told my parents.
I found the empty box.
It's snowing there.
There's something that isn't right.
The food is good.
We're well aware that it's a hard time now.
He works too much.
You're no longer children.
She's waiting for you now.
We don't have lots of time.
I thought she loved me.
Are your parents home?
We always help each other out.
It works both ways.
I thought he loved me.
I thought she loved me.
I don't know how he does it.
They work for me.
I want you to go.
Is he looking at me?
I know the reason you said that.
I don't have much ready money.
Do you remember when Tom said that?
You're the one who started this.
You're the one who started this.
Cum was pouring, there was a lot of cum.
Do you understand what that means?
I have known him for more than ten years.
Huskies love cold weather.
Does your wife know?
There's something that I've been wanting to say to you for a long time.
This is what I like about you.
This is what I like about him.
This is what I like about her.
Next please.
Why is it so?
I want you to start right now.

Do you want to know what's wrong?
I'll sleep here.
The child was asleep in bed.
You're like a brother to me.
We drank a lot.
Tom works for Scotland Yard.
I wasn't talking about you.
I used to work in a bank when I lived in London.
I was speaking of you.
This coffee is cold.
You're like a sister to me.
My English is bad.
I think my Japanese is really bad.
Have you already bought your ticket?
I love him, but he lives in another country.
I think Tom is right.
The village is now different from what it used to be.
What a beautiful baby!
I don't want him to see that.
I don't want her to see that.

I'm glad Tom helped us.
I know no one here.
They're already here.
As a rule, I don't drink.
Even Tom knows that.
Is Tom here yet?
Is that right?
He's not here right now.
Where's Tom? "How would I know?"

Don't talk to me that way.
Tom isn't sleeping now.
Does anybody have anything to say?
Nobody speaks to me.
I'm looking for somebody.
I saw him last weekend.
I saw him last week.
The beer's very cold.
The future is closer than you think.
Tom is far away.
I just have one question.
We're in 2013.
Every person is different.
The police officer asked me what my name was.
We do this every night.
Tom doesn't like you.
I'm looking for work, too.
You need to get a haircut.
I have to help my mother.
Why are you looking at me that way?
I think we have a lot in common.
As a rule, twins have a lot in common.
Don't just stand there.
Don't just stand there.
It's easier than I thought.
She drinks like a fish.
Say no to drugs.
Say no to drugs.
Just say no.
I know I love you.
Tom entered the room.
It's only three o'clock.
It's only three o'clock.
I don't have time to do it.
I work too hard.
We became good friends.
Now is the time.
Tell me what your name is.

You're just the person I've been looking for.
Do you realize what this means?
How much money do you have with you right now?
Tom isn't like me.
She waited for hours and hours.

Why am I crying?
She helped him.

I saw her earlier.
I'm good.
I'm sleepy!
I have something in my eye.
I am so sorry.
Everyone's waiting.
She has many dogs.

Things didn't go the way I planned.
Do you love me? "I don't know."
Is that so?
Don't let it get soiled.
What should I buy him for Valentine's Day?
The house that I live in is old.
Tom is making coffee.
I saw her somewhere two years ago.

You're handsome.
My sister and I have come.
How did he find us?
I think it's time for me to leave now.

She knows everything.
We're all friends here.
We were all on the bus.
Are you sleepy, honey?
Was that what Tom said?
Tom wanted you to come.
I don't think anybody's going to help you.
That cost him his job.
This is the place where my father was born.
Who is she and what's her name?
I'm looking for food.

Is your sister here?
Does he have a big family?
I'm not going to read it.
I won't say much.
We're like family.
We thought you were working.
It means that he likes you.
It means that he likes you.
It doesn't always work.
They didn't like Tom.
I want to help her, but I don't know how.
Tom still doesn't understand the problem.
Tell me why I'm here.
Tell me what you can.
Tell me how it works.
Did Tom tell you why?
Go to the living room.
Will Tom help us?
They know who we are.
You are a woman.
The crazier, the better.
Tomorrow is Friday.
I didn't see what was in the box.
I like the heat.
It was snowing.
You can come in now.
It is new.
Even Tom thinks so.
We are no longer young.
I can't wait anymore.
Why aren't you going? "Because I don't want to."
How much did the tickets cost you?
I like cities.
We like him.
Nobody likes him.
Nobody likes her.
Tom is a friend of Mary's.
Tom is just a friend.
Tom is just a family friend.
Will you tell me?

I haven't seen him.
We have been here for three days.
We have been here for three days.
Do you like mine?
I can't go out.

You won't be the only one there.
There's a cat there.
Whom are you looking for?
I think that's why Tom is here.
I think they know you.
I have a cat.
We don't have a problem.
I remember everything you tell me.
I remember saying that.
I wanted to know why you didn't come yesterday.
I only have one so far.
I know you know this.
The banks are closed today.
I know what the three of you want.
What did you say? I can't hear you.
I don't like it here.
Can I see you a second?

What questions do you have about Turkey?
Are you looking for this?
Are you looking for this?
You know me too well.
You know me too well.
Tom wants me to help him.
What the heck?
Susan’s clothes are dirty.
Don't tell me what I saw.
Don't anybody leave this room.
That's the best we have.
Don't look at it.
I'm working alone.
I have one.
I've got time.
That's the last thing I remember.
Everybody was looking at me.
Why is everyone looking at me?
Why is everyone looking at me?
I just wanted to say that I love you.
I know why you're here.
You're too little.
Are you looking at me?
Why are you looking at me?
I think about her a lot.
Women love that.
Your room is big.
Someone is looking at me.
He doesn't remember me anymore.
Didn't anyone tell you?
Does anyone have any other questions?
Tom told me he doesn't want to work with you.
I want to know what you see right now.
I'll tell you everything you want to know.
I don't work here.
I want to know how you know that.
Even in winter we don't have much snow.
What did you want to tell me?
When do you want me to start?
I didn't want you to read that.
They want to help us.
I don't want to see you.
Today I'm working from home.
I love things that are beautiful.
I thought you might help.
I thought you understood.
I can't tell what this is.
I never said no.
I can't go any faster.
No one works there anymore.
I can't. It's too big.
You've got a problem.
I can't wait.
I know that she doesn't know who I am.
He spoke for one hour.
You will always be there.
I knew I'd find you here.
I was just going to work.
Now what's wrong?
Is that a good thing?
You're a woman now.
Do you have to go now?
It is time to go.
I can't see.
Can you hear us?
If you don't know, who does?
Why are you all here?
They love us.
I don't really like him.
I'm from the city.
It's a bad time.
Do you want to tell me what this is?
You worked more than I did.
I do not like the house.
No one wants to go there.
I'm out of place here.
Is it too small?
Is it too big?
Don't look!
Yes, we can go.
Yes, we can go.
Does that mean yes?
Yes, that's normal.
No one will stop you.
It's not yet working.
She always says no.
Thanks, but no thanks.
He said no.
She said no.
We said no.
You said no.
You said no.
Tom is the only one who doesn't know.
Who else do you want to visit?
How long can you wait?
How long can you wait?
Tom isn't like us.
Nothing can stop us.
Tom is coming with us.
Can you go faster?
She is a bad person.
He is a bad man.
He's out of position.
I don't know what's going to happen.
That's what you think.
Which house is his?
How many people do you know well?
Why didn't she help you?
She's not as beautiful as her mother.
Do they know about us?
But I don't want to.
There isn't much time.
How are we going to get there?
They don't know me there.
There are a few problems.
I used to love her, but not anymore.
I said I wouldn't tell Tom.
She is not the kind of person you think she is.
Why don't you want me to know?
Why do you want to know what I'm thinking?
You may come in now.
Would you wait a second?
Are you telling me you are not my father?
I want some food.
They're not always there.
I've known him for one year.
I'm not very good.
I'm talking about my friend.
I think we've got a new problem.
How much does it cost for one person?
I think I've found something.
I believe that's it.
Is Tom here now?
I'll understand if you don't want to go there with me.
Wow, that was fast!
Wow, that was fast!
Tom is really smart.
How long did you stay there?
I never thought I would find a woman like you.
What sort of father do you think you'll be?
What sort of father do you think you'll be?
I love you more than he loves you.
He's my new friend.
There's a cat in my house.
I just knew you would say that.
This is the man I've been waiting for.
I'm going there now.
I think that Tom hasn't left yet.
Tom doesn't remember having said that.
Tom has gone out.
I've been looking for a new job for a long time.

I want to live in a world where people love one another.
Do you know us?
There are many abandoned cats in the world.
Come and help us.
We have time to spare.
Father is out, but Mother is at home.
Where does she live now?
Ask her when she will come back.
How do you feel about what she said?
They are not sisters.
Why didn't you tell Tom that?
Why didn't you help Tom?
Good, but you can do better.
What do you see now?
Tom found a good job near his house.
They remember you.

I remember writing to her.
I helped her with her work.
I have many things to do now.
He said that you need not go.
How long have you been here?
Here they come.
This is too big.
I'll tell him that.
How should I know where he is?
I have been reading this for a few hours.
I've been waiting for you for over an hour.
Do you think it's bad?
Are you younger than him?
You are free to go out.
I bought him a clock.

When will you begin?
When will you begin?
She can't stop her.

We gave our word.
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
I know you love him.
Tom is still working here, isn't he?
Everything is going well.
I'm not like other people.
Not all men are like that.
Not all girls are like that.
Where is she working now?
It had never happened before.
We're friends now.
Certain things are better left unsaid.
I'm ready! Can we go?
I have good days and bad days.
Do you think I like this?
