What're you doing?
It's not going happen.
Sometimes he can be a strange guy.
I've gotta go.
I told them to send me another ticket.
That's my answer!
If I could be like that...
This is what I would have said.
It's because you're a girl.
I think it is best not to be impolite.
Why are you asking?
I didn't know where it came from.
She's asking how that's possible.
You can do it.
I wish I could go to Japan.
I won't ask you anything else today.
It may freeze next week.
What has happened?
If you didn't know me that way then you simply didn't know me.
I don't understand what you mean.
I don't want to imagine ever looking up "Viagra" on Wikipedia.
No one will find out.
What did you reply?
I don't know what to do any more.
I didn't want it to happen.
It's not something anyone can do.
I don't know if I still have it.
What do you think I've been doing?
Whatever I do, she says I can do better.
I don't have anyone who'd travel with me.
Nothing is beautiful but the truth.
This is a pun.
No way!
We don't see things as they are, but as we are.
Love is never wasted.
He would be glad to hear that.
He's already a man.
I don't want to go to school.
What're you talking about?
Morning!
What do you want to do?
Please think about this.
Think about this.
Where is your house? "It is over there."
Who is that girl? "That's Keiko."
She takes a shower every morning.
For example, do you like English?
Do you know where my watch is?
I saw him running.
Man is the only animal that can laugh.
Don't blame it on her.
It may snow.
Georgia is his native state.
I'll stay here until ten.
Tom walked across the street.
This house has six rooms.
Where did you go yesterday?
Dad bought me books.
No matter what he does, he does it well.
He wrote a letter.
What do you think she is going to do?
I don't like any of these pictures.
You'd better leave.
Yesterday I was ill.
I passed by her house yesterday.
My father is tall.

I'd like to go to London.
I'd like to go to France.
Do you want to come along?
There's time for everything.
He resembles his father very much.
She was beautiful in her time.
I'll bring you the bill immediately.
She doesn't want to talk about it.
He died yesterday.
Yesterday, it was hot.
It was cold yesterday.
Yesterday was Thursday.
Michael Jackson has passed away.
Can I help you?
I live here.
I've never seen such a thing in my life, not once!
I'm going outside to play. Are you coming with?
Not for all the tea in China!
Just where were you?
Love if you want to be loved!
When two are doing the same thing, it is not the same.
Get out of my life!
The end crowns the work.
To each his own.
Don't forget the ticket.
This is Li Ying.
He seems to have been ill.
It's just around the corner.
I have four people in my family.
He talks as if he knows everything.
Take this medicine every six hours.
We waited long, but he didn't turn up.
Are your parents in now?
If I were you, I'd go home right away.
It tends to rain here a lot in the summer.
One after another the animals died.
How often do you see him?
Jill is the only girl in our club.
I've been in Sapporo before.
My sister is too young to go to school.
He had no difficulty in finding the place.
I will go when he comes back.
One of the twins is alive, but the other is dead.
I heard a young girl call for help.
He came in while we were at table.
While I see what you say, I can't agree with you.
Didn't you know that?

He wants a watch just like yours.
New York is the world's biggest city.

Who broke the news of her death to you?
There's something I want to ask you.
You can't do two things at once.
Tell me when to start.
I will go to Hokkaido tomorrow.
Do not read while walking.
East or West, home is best.
Many ways lead to Rome.
To see is to believe.
I never want to see you here ever again!
Let's get back to business.
Sometimes, things are more beautiful when you look at them from a different angle.
I'll never forget you.
I don't remember your name.
Nobody would visit me on my birthday.
I returned to Japan.
What are you going to do this evening?
Do you belong to the baseball club?
You should have told it to me sooner.
Now is the time when we must work together.
When will you get ready to leave?
I fail to understand his true aim.
Something may have happened to him.
I have just come back from school.
I think she is kind.
I cannot forget his kindness.
Where do you want to go this summer?
If it rains tomorrow, we'll stay at home.
My boss was forced to resign.
My boss was forced to resign.
Give me a bottle of wine.
Will I be able to see you next Monday?
Who wrote this book? "John did."
Do you have your own room?
You must keep your promise.
That was three days ago.
Autumn is when food is especially delicious.
My father has a lot of books.
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
I like the way she smiles.
We'll begin work soon.
Not knowing what to say, I remained silent.
She might come.
She didn't feel like eating lunch.
In my opinion, he's right.
It's raining hard.
Speak your mind.
She heard someone calling for help.
I'd rather stay home than go out in this weather.
When we are told not to come, we become all the more eager to go.
He deliberately ignored me when I passed him in the street.
All the members of our club, excluding me, are men.
Not all the books are worth reading.
I found the question very easy.
I found the question very easy.
It's not a class.
Rain, rain go away!
Finally!
I finally found the solution to the problem.
How are you doing? I haven't seen you for an age!
We have two ears.
This can't be true.
She may have known the answer.
Open your mouth!
Why do you ask?
Everything he says is true.
You're wanted on the phone.
The telephone rang several times.
The girl can't have done such a thing.
This problem is not so difficult as it seems.
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet.
It makes no difference to me whether he comes or not.
I was very much annoyed with him.
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet.
He left the house without so much as saying good-bye.
It's started to snow.
I don't have a clue.
Where did you see this woman?
I just got up.
Caesar is not above grammarians.
Hello, world!
Good morning, everyone.
She led the old man into the room.
I came from China.
So we'd better stay home.
I think that he won't come.
Is he coming? "No, I don't think so."
It's because you're a girl.
Good evening.
Good day, how may I help you?
Do as you were told to do.
Forget about it.
In that case, let's go.
You should go too!
It is getting darker. It may rain soon.
I went, too.
Cool!
You might not find it.
That's MY line!
I want to go to London.
Baristas need to make a sitcom.
But no, you will have your own way: 'I won't marry anybody but Vasily Gruskoff.'
Don't shout at me.
He keeps his word.
What do you think of this?
Is your brother's name Aleksej?
She has not replied.
How's life?
I've seen it with my own eyes.
I believe you.
He is a true man.
How is life?
I want your help.
This bus is going to Minsk.
People need to be more lively when presenting their work.
The author of the Slovio language has even made a porn site in it.
I'm going there alone.
I'm going.
I came, didn't I?
What is happiness?
I had never heard about Lviv before.
I think I would buy a nice car.
You've got to go.
It's a matter of life and death.
I want to know what you did this summer.
I decided to ask for my friend's help.
He has too many books.
What has become of your sister?
What grade is your sister in?
I used to play with my sister in the park.

Nancy looks like my sister.

Love and Peace.
I'd like a hotel reservation.
A fork is missing.
I'd like three of these.
You should take the number 5 bus.
What's your blood type?
I'd rather she sat next to me.
She expects him to show up on Saturday afternoon.
The work had been finished by six.
He doesn't have a mind of his own.
I'm thirsty.
I was hungry and angry.
I came to Japan last year.
I want your help.
Did you decide to go to Japan?
He came home three hours after that.
I know he did it.
I know that girl.
It started raining heavily.
Never has he returned since.
Please lend me this book for a few days.
Why doesn't he tell the truth?
We had a layover in Chicago.
He heard his name called.
There is a broad street near my house.
Saying and doing are two different things.
Japan is not what it was ten years ago.
I want to go to America some day.
My native language is Japanese.
This girl has no mother.
I'll show you the city.
If I wouldn't answer, I wouldn't talk.
It's eight a.m. right now.
I wake him up at 6 every morning.
How do I get to the police?
He didn't come to school yesterday.
You may sit wherever you like.
Everything is all right at home.
I'll ask him if he will come.
You should live within your means.
He went out of the room without saying any words.
He came after everybody had come.
Recently he's become a really nice person.
This is the book that I told you about.
In the best-case scenario, life is just a sea of troubles.
My friend George is going to Japan this summer.
Could you open the window?
I gave the correct answers to the questions.
Answer the question.
He came back after two days.
My son can already count up to one hundred.
Bring it to me.
I'm taller than you.
In any case, it's none of your business.
I've seen it myself.
Could I drop by your place one of these days?
We have two children.
Alice wasn't listening to her sister.
I work at this company.
As the weather became colder, he went from bad to worse.
This boy is his brother.
He comes here twice a week.
Jim is crazy about his girlfriend.
I want to go to Australia.
The phone doesn't work right now.
I'm thinking of going.
We’ll buy one car for each.
Mind your own business.
May I do it right now?
What my mother had said was true.
I don't like your girlfriend.
She gave him a clock.
What would you do if you had, say, ten thousand dollars?
He said that he doesn't know.
She believes her son is still alive.
I saw a man coming toward me.
I'll be back at ten.
Why can't you come?
He is rather behind the rest of his class in English.
Maybe, maybe not...
Harajuku is one of the hottest places in Tokyo.
There was a light rain yesterday.
It was a great blow to us.

Either you go, or I go.
He told me that his father was dead.
Our school is across the river.
All right. I'll come as soon as possible.

A big thanks for your help.
Do your own work.

At all costs, I want to live in America.
How would you like your coffee, black or with cream?
She cut the cake into six pieces and gave one to each of the children.
Take this medicine. You will feel better soon.
Nobody knows what has become of Yamada.
My brother must be sick.
I had to give up my plan.
Yeah, I've had it forever.
We never work on Sunday.
He lives next door but one to us.
He made a speech in connection with world peace.
These shoes are too small.
This is my father's.
We couldn't grasp the meaning of what he was trying to say.
He would often talk about the people he had lived among while he was in Africa.
All of you did good work.
Let's do this as a first step.
I helped my father yesterday.
What is the language spoken in Brazil?
Let me do this.
You're asking for too much.
Your memory is good.
I leave home before eight o'clock every morning.
He ran faster than his brother did.
What do you take me for?!
You can have this watch for nothing.
He brought his dog to school.
At last, we reached England.
How's it going with your family?
The two of us don't belong here.
I cannot say for sure where he lives.
If my mother were still alive, she would have helped me.
Yes, I went yesterday.
How do you feel? he inquired.
Father advanced me a week's allowance.
Is Mr Nakamura at home?
It's for my friend.
This house is very good.
What is the language spoken in Brazil?
Please sit down.
Please sit.

They as well as you are ordinary people.
He was thinking strange thoughts.
My house faces the sea.
He writes books.
He is taller than any other boy.
My town is not what it used to be.
He is a man of spirit.
I don't know if it is good.
He would often say such a thing.
If you do it at all, do it well.
I can't think of life without you.
He knows better than to go there alone.
You should start out as soon as you can.
Wouldn't you like to come with us, too?
My father works for a power company.
I've had it for today. I'm too tired.
He stood up so as to see the game better.
There was no wind at all yesterday.
Do come if you can!
I wish he had attended the meeting.
Ow-ow-ouch "Are you alright?"
I got up at seven.
Can you tell me where Main Street is?
Don't tell him the answer.

How's everything these days, Frank?
I moved nearer in order to hear better.
Was Ken at home yesterday?
What has become of the book I put here yesterday?
They are always short of money.
Don't believe everything that you hear.
He came home just now.
You can understand me.
None of your business.
I've got nothing to do with this.
You should set your room in order.
We want a house of our own.
Call the doctor right away.
He stood behind the chair.
What can I do?
You're Germans, aren't you?
There were scribbles all along the wall.
A child today would not do that.
Express yourself as clearly as you can.
We were forced to work hard.
Many things kept me from getting much sleep last night.
He is glad about his son's love of books.
The sun having set we stayed there for the night.
My father came home just now.
I can't remember how to go there.
Am I making sense?
Could you take this, please?
The baby needs its mother.
Everyone laughed at me yesterday.
I know the man sitting over there.
I walked in the woods by myself.
He is the very man that I'm looking for.
The play is at eight o'clock.
You'd better start as soon as possible.

And she'll never walk down Lime Street anymore.

We spent a quiet day in the country.
Yours is a very strange story.
This box is too heavy for me alone to lift.
He left his son a fortune.
He looked at the watch.
She inquired directions from the policeman.
He attended the high school for three years without missing a single day or being late.
I am on good terms with him.
I'm trying not to think about that.
I love you more deeply than I can say.
The good old days have gone, never to return.
Parents love their children.

Have you been to Hokkaido?
My family have lived here for twenty years.
He was sitting up straight.
Well, shall we call it a day?
Why didn't you get one before we left?
Keep hold of my hand if you're afraid.
She wanted to go out anyway.
How soon are we going to arrive?
And the boy did.
I wish he were here now.
He did not have enough money.
They offered the guests some coffee.
She was there all morning.
Ted loves his wife Elizabeth.
Will you stay at home?
It is easy to love, but hard to be loved.
And the boy did.
I started reading the book.
I started to write a book.
He is not like he seems.
He is playing here.
I took it for granted that you would come with us.
Everyone ought to be a master of his own destiny.
He was sitting on the floor.
We must begin before five.
The soldier lay injured on the ground.
Happily he did not die.
There was nobody.
Won't you go?
There is a large river near our town.
Sit tight.
I know the boy standing over there.
The dog must be hungry.
He ought to have arrived home by now.
How tall he is!
Ought I to go?
We didn't have much trouble.
I forgot your phone number.
She was glad of my company.
Are they open on Sunday?
He asked about you.
We had not gone so far when it started to rain.
I must go and see him.
When will you come back to school?
Stop beating around the bush.
I'm going to leave.
He's a good man and is known as such to everyone.
It would have been better if you had stayed in America.
The newly married couple walked hand in hand.
We happened to get on the same bus.
We had a heavy rain last night.
He lived a simple life.
The snow was knee deep.
They died one after another.
So many men, so many minds.
You can't put a "thank you" inside your pocket.
Betty killed him.
Betty killed her.
Have you been to London before?
What will become of the children after his death?
My friend remembered which way to go.
You should always tell the truth.
He has taken over his father's business.
The subject is too deep for me.
I want you to see her.
Please show me another.
We call the mountain Tsurugidake.
I plan to stay at home all day tomorrow.
We have enough seats for everyone.
That painting has started to grow on me.
My parents have just arrived at the station.
He always yells at me when he is angry.
Finally, she succeeded.
But the boy stayed away for a long time.
I'm sorry that you are leaving here.
I could have done better than he.
I'm going to study.
We get a lot of snow here in winter.
He comes here once a month.
He stood aloof.
I am starting this evening.
Sean really greatly resembles Conner!
Will you please show me the way?
I can not feel at home in a luxurious hotel.
What are you going to do today?
The other day I saw an old friend of mine.
I walked the length of the street.
You must do the work, even if you do not like it.
He led a life of vice.
Did you go to school yesterday?
The problem remains unsolved.
I'm writing a letter.
I have not had a bowel movement for a week.
He couldn't run very fast.
He looked up at the night sky.
Why? Because his family needed the money, that's why.
Do these paintings appeal to you?
It happened just like this.
I saw that he was right.
Then he lay on the same bed.
They shouted as loudly as they could.
We need that money.
That was a close call.
It's pretty cold today.
In a word, life is short.
My mother speaks slowly.
The family had a hard time after the war.
I got the ticket for nothing.
I think you're completely right.
He had few friends and little money.
Did they have to stay there all day?
Don't believe him.
On entering her room, she began to read the letter.
You were about to dump her flat out, weren't you?
And a little bread.
Their intimacy grew with the years.
My father likes his job.
How do people manage to sleep on the plane?
Are there taxis around here?
Some other boys came along.
Though he is old, he has a youthful spirit.
What would I do without you?
The worth of a thing is best known by the want of it.
I would go except for my headache.
Lincoln died in 1865.
The last chapter of this book.
It's the only thing I can think of.
What does he do?
How many books can I take out at one time?
Take as much as you want.
Razvan just left.
She came!
Are you just going to stand there all day?
How are you doing these days?
I am ready to go with you.
I'd like to come to see the doctor as soon as possible.
You can tell him for all I care.
You can tell him for all I care.
Where is your mother, boy?
Sam, what are you doing?
Will you write your name here?
I sort of understand.
You must do it at once.
Your boyfriend got tired of waiting for you and left just now.
I see a book on the desk.
I was ignorant of his plan.
I feel like I'm being drawn into your eyes.
That didn't help them any.
I am not writing a letter.
She is not such a girl as you imagine.
Please hold my place in line.
I'll be there at two o'clock without fail.
As I was tired, I went to bed.
We hardly had enough cake for every boy.
An enemy of an enemy is a friend.
These are my books.
He returned from the workshop.
Mostly likely, he's come back from the workshop.
The one who does not work, does not eat!
I'll come again when you are free.
You had better put the book back on the desk, for the owner will come back there.
Step aside.
Running as fast as she could, she still failed to catch the bus.
Sam, what are you doing?
That's enough.
My mind is made up.
The food's not ready yet.
It wasn't real love.
Bring the book to me, not to Tom.
I could hardly hear him.
Anyway, I don't like it.
That rings a bell.
I felt thoroughly lost in the crowded Ginza.
I'm not always home on Sundays.
There lived an old man in a village.
At the time, she gave no thought to her mother.
Stand up, please.
She had plenty of acquaintances, but no friends.
We are expecting company this evening.
You are too kind to me.
Have you had an answer?
I'm afraid not.
Do you have paper?
What's the reason?
What's the reason?
I will be back in an hour.
You must take things as they are.
It is easy to answer this question.
I opened my account with the bank.
Our restaurant is the best.
I believe in God.
Latin is the language of the future!
I'll return in ten minutes.
The patient lies in bed.
Hours pass, and she's counting the minutes.
I hear you've got a new girlfriend.
Faster, higher, stronger.
She has green eyes and light brown hair.
He could no longer wait and so went home.
I told her that you're a nice girl.
It will not be long before he turns up.
I have seen that girl before.
Let your food cool off a bit; don't eat it while it's hot.
The president doesn't see anybody.
He has no less than three-hundred books.
We have come a long way.
What have you come here for?
He ought to have come by now.
I'll send someone up to help you now.
I am acquainted with the author.
Jack and I agreed to work at the office on Saturdays by turns.
I've had it for today. I'm too tired.
The story seems true.
I don't have this book.
A is 5 times as long as B.
I can still see my mother's face.
I believe in him.
The girl standing over there is my sister Sue.
He doesn't read many newspapers.
Twenty years already passed.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
I have a feeling he is right.
Both of them are in the room.
Siemens. No family can do without us.
I'm a stranger here myself.
I am afraid of having trouble.
She stood up and walked to the window.
Since it rained, I did not go.
This book is heavy.
English is not my native language.
He is every bit a politician.
We were aware of what was going on.
He particularly liked history.
Not words but action is needed now.
He made up his mind to go there alone.
No one knows what'll happen in the future.
He was in France.
Here we are at Himeji Station.
I am the State!
Be yourself!
She answered easily.
He had to leave the village.
He is quite young in spirit.
What would you like to do in the future?
Where are they going to right now?
I have little more than 5 dollars.
I don't know what to do now.
Would you mind opening the window? "Of course not."
She lay on the bed with her eyes open.
What did you do with the money?
I would like you to make tea for me.
I was reading a book then.
She is popular with other girls.
Wouldn't you like to come with us, too?
I felt her eyes on my back.
I'd like a room with a good view.
He returned to his native village, where he spent the last few years of his life.
You will know the truth some day.
You must make up your mind, and that at once.
Were I in your position, I shouldn't know what to do.
What did you do then?
He is a Japanese boy.
The bus runs between the school and the station.
He is an unsung hero.
I'm old enough to live by myself.
I answered his blows with several of my own.
Could you send this letter to Japan?
He ran for his life.
What kind of soup is this?
They all stood for MRA.
What do you think of war?
What do you think of Japanese?
Give it to me, please.
Edward looked Kathy in the eye and asked her if she really meant what she said.
Is this your room?
I couldn't go out because it was raining.
Her house is across the river.
You cannot buy happiness.
How long will you be staying here?
The girls objected to our plan.
She was afraid to pass through the woods.
You told me so yourself.
He is writing to some friends of his.
All but Jim came.
Will you go to America next month?
Don't ask for money.
I have some English books.
I have not seen anything of Elizabeth lately.
It is not especially hot today.
She asked after her friend.
We yelled at her to take care.
I may indeed be wrong.
Come if you can.
What are you about now?
Is there a book on the chair? "Yes, there is."
She is as simple as a child.
The boy reading a book is John.
He has a strong mind.
I've had enough.
I could reply to all of them.
There is no chance of rain today.
He himself did it.
Thank you for asking me, but maybe next time.
He behaved badly.
She did not so much as cast glance at me.
My sister did not say "Hello".
She doesn't believe in God.
Haven't you decided yet?
He called me out.
I love you as much as him.
He wrote one letter.
She has fine features.
Something seems wrong.
The boy has a good school record.
Columbus discovered America in 1492.
You are either with us, or against us.
Which would you like?
She is always cold-hearted.
They did not have much food to eat.
Though I went to see her all the way in the rain, she was out.
He might come tomorrow.
Someone is standing behind the wall.
I am thinking of going to Kobe next week.
We need an ambulance.
What would you like to do today?
Don't speak badly of him in his absence.
You can't see the forest for the trees.
I didn't say such a thing of my own will.
What is your sister doing now?
Look at the girl whose hair is long.
I'm going to school.
It sounds to me as if he has something to do with the matter.
To tell the truth, he is not a human being.
Why don't you take the day off?
We were all running short of money then.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the room.
Just the same!
Are they writing a letter?
It snowed hard yesterday.
There is not much I can do to help, I am afraid.
I visited Rome for the first time in my life.
Come along with us if you like.
Thank you for your letter.
I can't trust in his word.
I know him by his first name.
I feel well today.
He was sitting drinking wine.
I have enough time for that.
He is not the man that he used to be.
He likes English very much.
Begin!
You could count to ten when you were two years old.
Mr Mailer is to stay here till tomorrow.
I'm not as tall as he is.
He kept silent for a while.
Let me go alone.
I cannot help believing what he says.
Forget it. It's not worth it.
You're speaking my language.
Cats have nine lives.
She can't cook well.
It happened while I wasn't looking.
I will be here tomorrow.
I would like to see your mother.
Paris is the center of the world, in a way.
I wanted to return to your village.
That has nothing to do with you.
To begin with, she is too young.
I walked along the footpath.
I wish you the same.
There are no houses around here.
Any bed is better than no bed.
Are you for or against this?
That boy is running.
The wounded soldier could hardly walk.
I'll be able to see him next year.
I wouldn't do it if I were you.
You should have left half an hour earlier.
This road leads you there.
I haven't seen anything of him lately.
Jim hasn't been home yet.
Why are your ears so big?
Could you tell me what to put here?
It seems that he left for school just now.
The problem is worthy of being remembered.
When do you think he'll be back?
I planned to introduce him to Beatrice.
What I'm saying is true.
I have great belief in the doctor.
I'm going to deal with the problem in this chapter.
My mother is a very good cook.
He suggested a plan similar to mine.
He sat down on the bed.
He looked at all the beautiful things in my house.
A woman was sitting on a stool in a bar.
What do you mean you don't know?!
He was looking for this very thing.
When did you come back from Tokyo?
I live with my uncle.
His story turned out true.
Has he returned yet?
That dog is loved by the whole family.
How many kilos may I take?
Where are my glasses?
He stayed there not more than four days.
He did what he could for his children.
I feel good today.
He won't turn up tonight.
A dog can run faster than a man can.
Do you walk hand in hand?
What happened to it?
That he is alive is certain.
He wants you to stay here.
Tom is taller than his mother.
Would you like more coffee?
Are you through with the phone?
I sat next to John.
The weather was very bad yesterday.
She did it easily.
I know it myself.
This watch is expensive.
So long, have a good time.
The story ends happily.
Anyone would find it hard to run on such a hot day.
These machines aren't working now.
Her words turned out to be true.
How's your new job?
Could I ask you to do that again?
Japan is bounded by water on every side.
I have a lot of books.
God knows why.
Take the book that has been left on the table.
I want to see the sights in Akiruno city.
He turned up an hour later.
I know the gentleman.
He will make my sister a good husband.
They are in class.
My brother is very tall.
I was very moved by his story.
We should make the most of every opportunity in our life.
I should like you to be my guest tonight.
Empty cans were scattered about the place.
I took a taxi because it was raining.
Both Ken and Meg are my friends.
We have no school today.
My father came back from Osaka last week.
He has a good case against her.
I'm supposed to go to New York next week.
I'm a man.
Nobody else offered to help.
My father is not always free on Sunday.
This is the very book I have been looking for.
That path is apt to be muddy after rain.
Please let me know the result by telephone.
What has become of him since then?
Come as early as possible.
They are in favor of your plan.
She worked on behalf of her family.
How does that seem to you?
Raise your hand before you answer.
He that cannot ask cannot live.
He was looking upward to the sky.
No living thing could live without air.
Tom walks very slowly.
I'll be damned if it's true.
Will you help me with this?
Because his father was working there.
Better a hundred friends than a hundred rubles.
When did he get back?
My uncle died of cancer.
You don't have to go unless you want to.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff.
I have nothing to do with them.
We should do away with these old rules.
Why don't you eat vegetables?
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
That was the first time I got on a plane.
Once you enter a company, you have to work for the company, whether you want to or not.
He returned home without telling us.
It's all over for you.
Finders keepers.
What are you going to do with this money?
He could not speak, he was so angry.
What newspaper do you take?
I wanna quit my job.
I wrote him to ask why.
When we looked down, we saw many buildings.
I could tell at a glance that something was wrong.
We considered going, but finally decided against it.
To begin with, you have no right to be here.
To say is one thing, to do is another.
She is a high-liver.
The day is short and there's a lot of work.
I don't like this. Show me another.
Do not read such a book.
How long have you been studying English?
Every boy and girl knows Columbus.
I believe in you.
The food disagreed with him.
What do I do next?
My hair is the longest in my class.
They refer to you as their friends.
At this, he got up and went out.
I have a bad pain here.
It was real hard work.
It could be true.
He noticed a letter on the desk.
These things always happen in threes.
I wish I had been there with you.
I'm very short of money.
Will he come tomorrow?
In the first place we must find a way out of this.
He keeps the room to himself.
No one knows what will happen in the 1990's.
I'm as tall as he is.
He returned home for the first time in ten years.
He is kind to those around him.
Whatever is worth doing at all, is worth doing well.
I played outside with everybody because weather was good today.
He died, so we might live.
He can read well.
I alone did it.
He is superior to me in English.
I don't know what happened to him.
I think it's OK.
I will never see him again.
You didn't seem to want that book.
He began to run.
I can't go to the restaurant with you tonight.
Even if you do not like it, you must take charge of it.
There is no reason why I shouldn't do it.
Whoever gets home first starts cooking the supper.
This road goes to the park.
His teeth had gaps.
Is everything OK with him?
Now, look at the picture, every one.
This book seems easy to me.
It was all our faults.
We have the question whether he did it by himself or not.
He was my dear friend.
Is the play still running?
She won't come just yet.
Have you answered that letter yet?
My sister has long legs.
Something was wrong with the watch.
I'm glad to see you back.
We didn't know which bus to take.
You must go to Harajuku.
I cannot tell which is the right side of this paper.
There weren't any children in the park yesterday.
It's a good plan.
He can neither read nor write.
Today I feel better than I did yesterday.
What do you do in your spare time?
Paul is always groping women.
If anything bad should come about, let me know.
He lost no time coming back.
You must bear in mind what I've just said to you.
She was across in ten minutes.
Are you familiar with that person?
I will accept the work, provided you help me.
The trees are green.
He bought a small house in Kyoto.
You may not believe it, but it is nonetheless true.
We can seat you soon.
She's not a doctor.
I don't know who wrote this letter.
He who laughs last, laughs best.
Windows 95 crashed on me AGAIN!
What is he talking about?
He's still alive.
People often say that Japanese is a difficult language.
They did not know it themselves.
He is a little over forty.
This letter arrived while you were out.
Sure. What can I do?
When will she come home?
I have been to Paris.
Hello everybody!
That's my book.
Is there a table available for two on Friday?
Please tell me the answer to the question.
I don't like the bad boy.
I'm afraid you can't.
What do you do here?
You can see the whole city from this hill.
Ken must be home by now.
Tell me when to stop.
The wind blew hard.
All the members of the club agreed with me.
The old man was loved by all.
Look at that mountain.
The time will come when you will understand this.
Twenty families live here.
You talk as if you knew everything.
Your bike is better than mine.
I'm not about to ask him.
I have a toothache.
I love my work a lot.
Hello, Tom. Good morning.
Good day!
It's a very strange case.
I recognized your voice right away.
Don't make fun of them.
She needed the money desperately.
He came a little earlier than he used to.
The flat is on fire.
I'll never forget how kind you have been.
We work every day except Sunday.
He offered his help to us.
Everyone in his family is tall.
He gave him the book.
French is her first language.
Do you know when he will come?
She looks a lot like her mother.
What's my room number?
I don't think she will come back by five.
This watch is less expensive than that one.
What do you think of this?
I will come by all means.
By the way, where are you from?
I can't agree with you.
Nothing is wrong with you.
Jeff searched for three months before he found a job.
At a glance, he knew that the child was hungry.
He is a writer.
This is my school.
These are our books.
Beasts are numerous as fuck in this forest.
It just so happened that I was free last Sunday.
Ken has more books than you.
Your father is tall.
They usually say that women live longer than men.
I had to stay in bed all day.
Who is the man sitting at the other end of the table?
How much is the whole package?
May they live long!
Imagine that you have a time machine.
Have you ever been to Tokyo?
Are you for or against the plan?
You may have heard of that.
We were all scared shitless.
It's time to get to work.
We all abide by law to live in any society.
Are you satisfied with the result?
What would you say if you were in my place?
Shall I ask Peter for help?
I know what you're feeling.
The girl is afraid of dogs.
Bill often fails to keep his word.
What's my book doing here?
One day I will meet him.
Will you show me the way to the bank?
God's tired of loving us.
You must be here till five.
I won't go there anymore.
He chose to live in Tokyo instead of Osaka.
You must work more.
He didn't know that.
My son is taller than I am.
I am going to spend the weekend in Tokyo.
Men can not exist without air.
Where's your father?
Where did you see that woman?
He will not listen to me.
There is a book on the table.
Where have you seen these women?
She is writing a letter now.
His family are all very well.
Could you please tell me why you love her?
What's your phone number?
I came to kill him.
What do you imagine when you see that picture?
How many books do you read a month?
He didn't know that.
Who's this guy?
At last, the bus stopped.
English is a language spoken all over the world.
Hard work has made Japan what it is today.
I have always wanted to go to Australia with my family.
I wouldn't want to tell him the truth.
Betty killed her own mother.
He has three older sisters.
Do you need this book?
His older sister is older than my oldest brother.
How old is your oldest son?
He has three older sisters.
I was young, and I wanted to live.
Where did you see those women?
Where did you see that woman?
You're in better shape than I am.
I don't know if I have the time.
My brother died of that shit.
I was in the mountains.
They succeeded in getting that job.
Sometimes he can be a strange guy.
They were successful in solving the problem.
That won't happen.
It's because you don't want to be alone.
You are in my way.
That house is very small.
That house is big.
I wish I could buy that house cheap.
What happened last night?
I came to Tokyo three years ago and have been living here ever since.
I am a doctor.
Have you read this article?
A cat was sitting on the chair.
Why don't you go home early today?
There's no wind today.
I'm out of shape today.
Japanese is our mother tongue.

You don't need to hurry.
Machines can do a lot of things for people today.
The boy entered by the back door.
This room is large enough.
His new book is going to come out next month.
I hear he has been ill since last month.
I'm going.
I was expecting it!
Look at me, please.
Whatever he asks you, you mustn't answer.
I'll give you the book.
They were abandoned by their mother.
We had neither known nor heard about it.
They named their son John.
What's the problem?
I like languages.
I understand your language.
She's my sister.
He can speak eight languages.
What's today's date?
He doesn't speak our language.
What language do people speak in Korea?
She raised her hand for the bus to stop.
Would you please answer as soon as you can?

There are big stones on the ground.
This isn't what I asked for.
How much does this watch cost?
Open your eyes.
I got a letter from a friend.
What're you doing now?
What're you thinking about?
Please have some pie.
Tell me what happened.
Do you want to come along?
I won't come back.
Who wrote the two letters?
Next summer, I want to go to Hawaii.
I live in a flat.
Here's your dog.
Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.
I'm so happy for you.
I'm so happy for you.
What were you doing yesterday?
What were you doing yesterday?
Please reserve this table for us.
I won't do it again.
This table is just as large as ours.
To look at him, you'd take him for a girl.
We have to get off at the next station.
She is less beautiful than her sister.
Let me know the days when you can come.
Her hair is long and beautiful.
I asked him to answer soon after he received my letter.
What a strong wind!
At that time, my mother was younger than I am now.
You talk so fast I can't understand a word you say.
The girl has no mother.
What a boy!
Tom is lying ill in bed.
My sister is older than my brother.
He is very afraid of his mother.
Your father has been in Paris, hasn't he?
Marilyn Monroe died 33 years ago.
I like this dog.
Let's begin with that question.
It seems to me that you are wrong.
It is a very strange letter.
They said that contact with the plane had been lost.
Where's your school?
However that may be, I am wrong.
What gives?
Don't ask what they think. Ask what they do.
This room is too small to contain 50 men.
What the bloody fuck is that?
Who is the girl?
This word comes from Greek.
The river flows through the city.
Can I go to work?
Please answer all the questions.
I'd like it in a brighter color.
Judging from the present look of the sky, we may have a downpour any moment.
He is my boss.
He came back soon.
Please give me some water. "All right."
He shall not come into this house again.
We don't care what he does.
Not knowing what to do, he asked me for help.
Please make yourself at home.
I plan to stay there one week.
How many books are there on the table?
I haven't seen you for ages. Do you remember when I saw you last?
You're a good boy.
What school do you go to?
How much rent do you pay for the apartment?
He suggested to me that I should take her there.
There are more girls than boys in this class.
Your uncle and I have known each other for many years.
When to start is the main problem.
I never see you without thinking of my dead son.
Everybody knew her true feelings.
If it were not for air and water, we could not live.
Their baby is able to walk already.
I'm looking for my glasses.
I wish we had more time.
You should stop drinking.
I love you with all my heart.
You're no doctor.
Ken has no more than ten books.
Can you see that small house?
You may borrow this book as long as you keep it clean.
Do it right now, before you forget.
Before I forget, I will tell you.
Shut the window, Jim.
I don't know who painted this picture.
Will the police come?
I'll let you decide.
Even if I admit that, I cannot agree with you.
Though she was tired, she kept on working.
I'll be here by Monday.
It's very cold this winter.
I can't figure out what he means.
They believe in a life after death.
She writes me every week.
Paul has three sons. They look very much alike.
I have not seen him since then.
Are you a believer?
You should always save money for a rainy day.
Send for the doctor.
It's your book.
You drank alcohol again? I told you not to!
I have forgotten.
I had some trouble in finding his house.
You might at least say "thank you."
It's my favorite food.
I do not like him either.
Someone must have left it there.
Never hesitate to tell the truth.
He told me that whatever might happen, he was prepared for it.
I don't remember exactly, but I suppose it was Friday last week.
I can't agree with you on that point.
The boy is yet to be found.
Who could that have been?
She looked him in the face.
I'm staying at the Sheraton Hotel.
Ten days passed by.
He enjoys his position.
They fear that he may be dead.
Look straight ahead.
He comes from England.
I'll buy a watch for my son.
They live on the other side of the road.
My mother had been cooking supper for two hours when I got home.
This is the reason why I came here.
This is my mother.
What shall I do?
Will you come back tomorrow?
Can you solve the problem by yourself?
It's getting colder and colder.
Don't play in this room.
You are much too kind to me.
He took off his glasses after that.
She is writing a letter now.
This is my problem.
He's a smart boy.
I've got to help him.
She is not my mother but my oldest sister.
The language spoken in Australia is English.
We call him "Skunk Man".
Allah rocks!
He has a good memory.
Don't breathe a word of it to anyone.
Ask him whether they still live in Tokyo.
I also heard a similar story.
Come back to me.
This is my wife Edita.
I will read a book.
Can you call me a taxi?
Will he come? "No, I don't think so."
You can't live on this side anymore.
You can't live on this side anymore.
It was the best day of my life.
What's that tall man playing?
You've had enough time.
French is her first language.
Where're you going?
Will he come tomorrow?
I slept with my boss.
I slept with my boss.
There were already over 20 people sitting there.
That incident is printed on my mind.
What're you doing?
Do you like this book?
You may stay here if you want to.
When will you come back?
She thought that I was a doctor.
He lives alone in an apartment.
She will come if you ask her.
I don't think we should do that.
This game can be played by young children.
When can I see you?
I don't know if she will come.
Is that your book?
It was more and more hard to live in the village.
Don't take it personally.
How many books have you got?
Everything has got its time.
That's my dog.
I found the room empty.
He is easy to reach.
Saying is quite different from doing.
I am never at home on Sundays.
I'd like three twenties, six fives, and the rest in ones.
Was there anyone in the room?
He wanted to buy a book.
Machines that his company produces are superior to ours.
He is going to go to school tomorrow.
He is my brother's friend.
You should be responsible for your actions.
You are as tall as I am.
It is better to do well than to say well.
I went to her house, but she was not at home.
As soon as we sat down, she brought us coffee.
They are as strong as us.
I'm about to tell you the answer.
My father came home at nine.
I don't like those who say so.
Sleep is better than medicine.
I don't know what you want to do.
I'm glad you were able to come.
I want to see it for myself.
No problem at all!
Do you have any further questions?
No, it gains ten minutes a day.
He cried: "Help!"
I read a book.
She slapped me on the chin.
Can you practice Japanese with me?
His house stands by the river.
Let's sing.
I had a stillborn baby three years ago.
The baby smiled at me.
He was lying on his back, looking at the sky.
He's intelligent, but I still don't like him.
I was glad to see her.
She is different from her sister in every way.
I asked my mother what to bring there.
It was fine all day.
I don't believe it!
I have to go now.
The child bears a closer resemblance to his mother.
He can't be ill.
It's an answer to her letter.
It is a task beyond my power.
Think nothing of it.
I don't have time now.
Is he a doctor?
It can happen to anybody.
This is my second experience flight with plane.
His father eats there twice a week.
That is our school.
Bill brought me this book.
I don't entirely understand what he said.
Do you know when they will be back?
What should I bring?
I'm tired of living this life.
Leave it where you found it.
Do you need our help?
She left home just now.
We must know. We will know.
Is his father a doctor?
What will actually happen is anyone's guess.
You've come back?
Is it possible to see Venus tonight?
I must return home within a week.
John is senior to Robert.
Talk to me!
I solved the problem easily.
They left at 5 o'clock, so they ought to be home by 6.
All you can do is wait.
He was too young to go to school.
It may or may not be true.
I would like to see my father.
She looks young, but she's actually older than you are.
He speaks five languages.
It would have been better if you had left it unsaid.
Why did you come to Japan?
He doesn't believe in God.
Thanks for the memories.
Aron killed Elizabeth.
What would you like to eat for dinner?
Attention!
I asked Ken to help me.
You shouldn't have come so soon.
Please explain why it is that you can't come.
A question to which yes or no will not quiet suffice.
I don't need your help.
Let the tea draw for ten minutes.
Everybody laughed at Jack.
He didn't fear death.
I studied last night.
I studied last night.
What should I do about this?
It seemed that there was no one in the village.
I don't believe in God.
You have my word.
Be quiet and listen!
Everyone knows the law.
Won't you give me a little money?
He'll come soon.
You can go wherever you want to go.
I'm too old for this world.
Thanks for the help. "Don't mention it."
It's raining again!
I like the mountains more than I like the sea.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat's black and the dog's white.
This telephone is out of order.
I was unable to look her in the face.
Everyone is afraid of doing new things.
I wish Jim would behave himself.
Could you drive more slowly?
Why were you absent yesterday?
He died when he was 54 years old.
Tell me why you want to go there.
I know his name.
All of us like her.
Don't sleep with the windows open.
I was at Kyoto once.
I know how to solve the problem.
He sat there with his legs closed.
She looked him in the face.
Who can say what will happen in the future?
He felt a pain in his back.
One must do one's best in everything.
Please send the letter by express.
This road extends to the coast.
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.
I have a bottle of whiskey.
He's afraid of the dog.
I think you should see a doctor.
We listened to her for some time.
It is very cold today, isn't it?
My love for him has already cooled.
What are you going to do with the money?, asked the policeman.
Did you hear that, Mike?
My father died of cancer.
Let me have a look at it, will you?
This is the room into which he went.
Father has never gotten sick in his life.
He left.
She asked me if I was all right.
The sea is not clear.
I'm feeling better today.
He's no doctor.
My phone number is 789.
My room number is 5.
Betty killed them all.
Tell me how to play the game.
That is the absolute truth!
She didn't know what to do with the problem.
It started raining.
I think I need braces.
I'll be back next week.
I have a problem with my car.
I really love my work.
It just was not my day yesterday.
Hideyo Noguchi was a great man.
The work was very difficult.
Give me a blank sheet of paper.
No one can do that.
Are these cars yours? "Yes, they are mine."
The problem is in that we don't have enough money.
I think I understood.
I can run as fast as Bill.
I think he'll never return.
I have three times more books than he has.
He took off his glasses.

What're you doing?
She went out without saying a word.
I'm going to go.
Who is the author of this book?
This boy is from Columbia.
You should tell him the truth.

No one has come.
I went to America last fall.
To tell the truth, they are not husband and wife.
I must open the window.
Was it rainy in London?
Air is polluted in cities.
By the way, are you free tonight?
When did it occur?
What have you come here for?
It's already been ten years since my father passed away.
May you have happiness.
I don't know if this is true.
China is twenty times bigger than Japan.
What form of transport will we take?
I put my hand on his shoulder.
Do you know your blood type?
Anyhow let's begin.
How many times a month do you write letters?
I prefer to die than to do that.
I don't know what to do next.
I haven't seen her for ages.
Take the other chair!
That's my answer!
Open your eyes.
Do not start if afraid, once begun do not be afraid.

Tomorrow I'm going to Paris.
I want to be loved.
Be loved.

Don't you laugh at me.
In my room, there are no clocks.
Is this your family?
He saw he was wrong.
He knows little about that animal.
He isn't so tall.
He has long hair.
It's raining again.
I no longer need it.
There's only one thing we can do now!
The future was five minutes ago.
I don't remember exactly.
Everyone speaks a language.
I'll never forget your kindness.
He is the very man I want.
Stay a little longer.
Leave it!
He will not be back tomorrow.
I'm still not ready.
You may go there.
There were strange things happening there.
Forget it. It's not worth it.
I can respond to his question.
I didn't know she was ill.
Tomorrow is the last day of school!
Man is the only animal that can laugh.
I have the same trouble as you have.
I can't sleep at all.

Whatever may happen.
His story seems to be strange.
Drop dead!

He will be back in ten minutes.
We didn't stay home yesterday.
Would you like some coffee?
Thanks again for everything.
They are not my real parents.
This medicine will make you feel better.
It might rain before evening.
The box, which I had found was empty.
We will die sooner or later.
I am reading a book about animals.
What happened here?
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
He was holding a large box in his arms.
That is because human beings are mammals.
Do you know the way?
This is my wife Edita.
I don't mind.
I asked where to go.
Every time I see him, he is smiling.
It's finally Friday.
Life is hard.
Is she your sister?
Nobody knew that.
I shut up.
Look at this house.
I like your car.
Father stopped drinking.
The clock stopped.
When there's a will, there's a way.
Money can't buy you everything.
Are both of you ready to go?
Are both of you ready to go?
She must have gone out.
Everybody seeks happiness.
He believes whatever I say.
He believes whatever I say.
No, you won't.
That's enough for now.
The sisters look like each other.
Do you need an ambulance?
How are you doing? I haven't seen you in ages!
Now I feel the same.
The car passed through a gate.
That is what we want to know.
Last week she gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.
I don't understand what you are trying to say.
My friend has a large family.
Read as many books as possible.
He died five years ago.
We've been here long enough.
Act. Don't talk.
It's a new book.
I've forgotten his name.
I've forgotten her name.
John is my best friend.
She must have done it yesterday.
Apart from her, everybody answered the question.
Ken mistook you for me.
Ken's turn came.
I do not know what I will do.
I'll see them tonight.
I believe it to be true.
This is where my family used to live.
Nobody but John has heard of it.
Nobody but John has heard of it.
He is not strong as before.
French is his mother tongue.
Do you mind if I join your trip to the country?
I am going to write about our parks and mountains.
Go ahead to the end of the street.

She died of cancer.
She came to see us yesterday.
It was night.
Will you go?

He just left.
I saw the man get ganged up on.

How to explain it?
No one has ever seen God.
I want a friend.
That's easy.
He makes it a rule not to eat too much.
Her name was Linda, and she was a year younger than Tony.
Are you still asking yourself what the meaning of life is?

Tell me what he said.
Do you believe what he said?
Only a few understood what he said.
The dog followed him wherever he went.
I don't care whether he leaves or stays.
I'm cold. May I close the window?

I have an uncle who lives in Kyoto.
He came back three days after.
We hear with our ears.
I'll take the yellow one.
Nothing is as it seems.
What do you do on Sundays?
We are against working on Sundays.
My uncle has a large family.
Follow behind me.
Should I tell them the truth?
Who's coming with me?
Is your school far away from your house?
You must make it clear whether you can come.
Do you know who he is?
You didn't know that either.
This water is a little salty.
Please excuse me for calling you so early in the morning.

Did you make it for yourself?
You can do that.
How do you account for that?
Do you have that bottle?
You can open the window.
I can sleep in peace after this.
All of us, except him, went.
You may be correct.
The cat is very cute.
You did it!
You don't like love stories.
You should know better.

Maybe you're right.
Maybe you're right.
I'd like to say yes, but...
I'll pay for it.
When did that happen?
Answer me, please.
I would like to ask.
He stood up.
Take things as they are.
I want to do this myself.
He is very kind.
Let's begin at the beginning.
Maybe she knows the answer.
He, if anything, is the romantic type.
You're quite correct.
I want to be you.

Explain that to me.

I have a home in the mountains.
I stayed home all day.
Hurry up!
This animal is bigger than that one.
Will John come to see us tomorrow?
How much do you leave for a tip in Spain?
Why are you afraid?
I don't have the time or the money.

It's a happy thing.
It's the first time in my life I've felt so connected with someone.
I'll bear that in mind.
I've always been the number one.
My wife never wanted to have kids.
Now I can finally sleep easy.
He counts fast.
Whatever you do, do it as best you can.
Please continue.
I give you my word.
The sun is red.
Next time I will do it myself.
English is difficult, innit?
Is the school on this side of the river?

Don't expect others to think for you!
Nobody knows what has become of her.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
Excuse me, who is this woman?
That girl is very beautiful.
Do you know what he did?
The only access to the village is from the river.
That girl is very beautiful.
Who's that?  "It's your mother."
She wouldn't speak to him.
Put it where you like.
We anticipate a heavy rainfall tomorrow.
Will you marry me?
He spent all night cramming for the test.

Just like you want it to.

I have the best mom in the world!
I have the best mom in the world!
He played the part of Hamlet.
I'll wait here until he comes back.
I think he'll understand this.
Why are you afraid?
I've just come back from Sweden.
Everybody should have a purpose.
Speaking.
I often hiccup.
You must do it.
He was speaking.
I don't know where to go or what to do.
They never go out in the evenings with their children.
Tom doesn't know his own strength.
I thought it was true.

Must I go with you?
When and where did you buy that old clock?
It's not over until the fat lady sings.
Tom has gone crazy.
His sisters as well as he are now living in Tokio.
Is it raining?
I did not understand.
Do you want to sit?
This was missing.
I see the dog.
Was he lying on his back?
I guess I'm not as smart as you.
You can do it.
I took the wrong bus.
Is eating people wrong?
Why do we dream?
We all missed you.

If Kyosuke comes to visit, tell him I'm not in. I don't want to see him anymore.

Do you have any plans for tonight?
How do you do it?
He is quite right.
I try with all my might.
I stood all the way.
I'm off duty.
Probably not.
Do you believe me?
I thought he would come alone.
He was reading a newspaper.
They say that he's still alive.
We do what we must because we can.
See you tonight, then. Cheers!
Rie and I went to the same school.
I don't quite believe what he says.
I loved my life and my money.
They made me go there.
I've been at home.
You're German, aren't you?
How about another round?
What a friend you are!
What do you usually do on Sundays?
Tom definitely won't work for less than $300 an hour.
This car is as good as new.
Some day I want to go to New York.
I won't do that. I'd rather die.

It's my full-time job.
I feel that I understand your feelings.
Yeah, fat chance!
I'm a child, I need love!

Bill wrote the letter.
I can't understand what he is trying to say.
Laugh with them.

If you die, I'll kill you!
Trust me!
I bought a newspaper written in English.
He gave me food and money as well.
See what I mean?
You see what I mean?

I'll keep my fingers crossed.

Just forget it.
Lo and behold!
You go on alone.
He will be laughed at by his friends.
What's beside the desk?
Should I go or would you like me to stay?

How do you feel? he asked.
How fast Tom works!
Where is the book?
I'd like a room with a good view, please.
I gave him the book.
I told the policeman what I knew.
Will you stay here for a while?

This ticket lets two people in.
Oh, really?

Let's send for the doctor.
Nobody lives in this house.
I know your brother very well.
This dog is the biggest in this town.
Can you think of anything else?

Not in my backyard.
I wrote a letter last night.
A boy spoke to me.
I like reading books.
It's October the third.
Don't listen to him!
Give me a drink, please.
Tom is a stranger in this town.
Why did you decide to speak about that now?
All of my siblings are taller than me.
All of my siblings are taller than me.
Come whenever you want to.
I have no one to help me.
You have to go.

I shower every day.
The old woman is a doctor.
These books are my best friends.

Mr Tanaka, you are wanted on the phone.
I believe Elvis is still alive.
She writes to me once a month.
Come over!

Goodbye!
Goodnight!
There is much water left.
Tom knows what he's talking about.
The soldier was wounded in the leg.
I cannot remember her name.
The man fell down on the ground.
Don't go against the rules.
I got tired of hearing the same thing so often.
The more people have, the more they want.
Slaves did most of the work.
Franklin Roosevelt became president in 1933.
I'll never forget having a good time with you all.
I eat and read at the same time.
Help me stand up.
Help me stand up.
Help me stand up.
Help me stand up.
Red wine, please.
Come here!
I think the same way as you do.
If I had only known before!
A big dog is always beside him.
They say he's a good doctor.
When she saw that the people were hungry, she begged for food for them.

I am not afraid.
I feel that I am free.
I don't know what to do now.
Are you listening?
We expect good results.
I'm staying home.
I was in Kyoto twice.
I've already done that.
It is easy to read this book.
Do you like to be alone?
How's your wife?
I'm fat.
The dog is red.
Will you go with us?
My ears hurt.
How's your sister today?
I love my wife.
Eat whatever you want.
I'd like to get home by five.
He is like his father.
Tom is a friend of a friend of mine.
I wanted to go there.
Tom likes to talk on the phone.
Think before you speak.
Can you lift this stone?
I want to go to America.
The old man said something.
That boy has black hair.
I'm not a doctor.
Today I love the entire world.
My sister often cries.
He's a blue blood.
Are you a doctor?
Look behind you!
I don't know if he's a doctor.
I have a feeling that she'll come today.
I tell you the truth.
Is everything in order?
I think you need to think about the future.
They are reading their newspapers.
Do you believe him?

The meeting started at ten.

He spent the evening reading a book.
I read that the president of Brazil is a woman. Her name is Dilma.
Tom had no problem doing it.
Tom had to go himself.
Tom had to catch a taxi.
How many nights will you stay?
I felt a cold wind on my face.
He has already gone home.
I don't have any money and I don't have any friends either.
I could hear the voices of several other guests who had arrived and were already eating together in the main dinning room.
I read that the president of Brazil is a woman. Her name is Dilma.
You must work.
She went out without saying goodbye.
Where did she buy books?
She's very afraid of snakes.
He doesn't yet know the truth.
She is no less beautiful than her sister.
She looked at me and smiled.
The three sisters look very much alike.
I reckon we'll see him once more.
Our world is getting smaller and smaller every year.
She will write to me as soon as she returns to her country.
That's not what I meant.
That isn't what I'm talking about.
I didn't mean that.
Are you listening to me?
Eat and drink.
Eat and drink.
Did you go to school today?
Watch him and do the same thing.
You may sit here.
You may sit here.
She was very excited.
I'm not hungry at all.
If you say that to your mother, she'll kill you!
He drove to school.
I'll never leave you.
It turned out that he was her father.

John sat with arms crossed.

I am a stranger here.
He is always in the background.
I may die tomorrow.

Please speak more loudly so that everybody can hear you.
Come nearer so that I can see your face.
In 1943, Japan was at war.
I don't know exactly.

It was years ago.
Tom is on good terms with John.
Let me tell you about the case.
When she entered the room, he stood up.
They like to play in the snow.
The bar is open until six in the morning.
Love and Peace.
I would like to be Picasso.
Has something happened?
Eat your soup before it gets cold.
Have you gone mad?
What did the boy say?
Jack was laughed at by all the boys.
Tom shouldn't have said that.
Tom explained the reasons for his decision.
His name is known to everybody in this area.
What was it?
He was regarded as a hero.
Since you're here, you can help me.
I love life.
Do you believe in spirits?
I know your first name.
Alice is sleeping in my room.
Do what you've been told.
How much do I owe?
Have a nice trip!
His behaviour was bad.
Where has she come from?
China is the biggest country in Asia.
Maybe it's true.
That seems weird.
I wrote this book.
Have you gone completely mad?
Even though he was sick, the boy still went to school.
You like English, don't you?
Good day. See you soon.
I walk to school every day.
Write to him right away.
Tom wouldn't say that.
Five thousand dollars is a large sum of money.
No one wanted to talk about it.
Those who know do not talk. Those who talk do not know.
Is this the bus for Park Ridge?
Look who's talking.
Is his father alive?
I'm ready to leave now.
I stayed at his place yesterday.
I'll come to visit you at your house tomorrow.
Tom certainly knows how to make money.
It is very hot here in the summer.
I've never thought about this, said the man. "What should we do?"
All the women thought Tom was really handsome.
It is not clear when and where she was born.
I didn't notice it.
They stayed at home because it was very cold.
That dog is big.
Water is heavy.
The result is neither good nor bad.
My son can neither read nor write yet.
I don't know how to explain it.
Take this medicine twice a day.
The French and Indian War had begun.
I'm game for it.
We will have to do something.
It has nothing to do with him.
We're in good shape.
Tom may not come.
How did you open the box?
Was Joe with you yesterday evening?
Almost no one believes her.
Things are not what they seem.
I'm afraid of cats.
He doesn't believe me at all.
The jet landed at Tokyo.
I dreamed about Yumi.
Your feet are dirty.
You've got to answer the question.
Come on.
The earth is smaller than the sun.
Where do you want to go?
I'm not what I used to be.
Leave my things alone.
He did say so.
Animals are afraid of fire.
Short hair really suits her.
When will you be back home?
My phone doesn't work.
It was raining heavily in Osaka.
What do they call their baby?
It was cold in the summer of this year.
Please tell us what to do next.
You can borrow my car anytime.
His doctor told him not to drink alcohol.
There are more cars on the road in the summer than in the winter.
He often absents himself from meetings.
Did you accomplish your goals?
The old man was sitting there, with crossed legs.
I want you to stay with me.
I wish I were as handsome as he.
I can't make out what he says.
Read after me all together.
This evening we'll go home.
You’ll be killed!
The game will start in an hour.
How long it is!
My uncle was standing there with his arms folded.
Can you do that? I think so.
It's you I'll always love.
We must have faith in the president.
Speak a little louder.
This watch doesn't work.
He has been sick for a week.
Mike is the youngest in his family.

Where is the school?
Would you like to live in Mumbai?
Ireland and England are separated by the sea.
Think about your future.
Thank you for listening.
Tom doesn't believe in life after death.
I wish today were Friday.
She went there by herself.
Why didn't you look at the picture?
I don't really read newspapers.
You can't believe anything that guy says.
Your brother is very angry.
She always smiles.
It has been a long time since I wrote you last.
I can't decide whether to go or not.
I'll kill you.
Where did he do it?
What's Tony doing?
You don't know how to do it, do you?
My house is near the school.
I recognized her as soon as I saw her.
I woke up three times during the night.
I don't know if she will go there with me.
It's my fault, not yours.
I asked him to open the window.
I'm too fat.
I was captured.
Nobody came to help me.
This idea has never entered my head before.
I think you know what I mean.
As soon as he returns, I will tell you.
Somebody wants to kill me.
It is now eight in the morning.
My hometown is in the center of Hokkaido.
Tom didn't do much work today.
Is there any need for me to go there?
Tom yelled for help.
Many things happened on the same day.
I hear he is looking for work.
I heard my name called.
Whatever you may say, I don't believe you.
It was such a cold day that there was nobody on the street.
I like history.
If there's anything I can do for you, please let me know.
The days are getting shorter.
It will not be long before he gets better.
Just tell me what you'd like me to do.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
I'm anxious to see you.
He's not always at home on Sundays.
Nobody was injured.
She loved her mother dearly.
We all try to get together at least once a year.
Think of everything that you have, and not on the only thing that you are missing.
She's going to kill me.
She's going to kill me.
You will go to school.
If you don't want to do it, don't!
Our school is near a park.
Please forgive me for not having written sooner.
What am I to do?
She presented me to her brother.
Do you believe in God?
What would you like? "I would like a dog."
If so, what should we do?
I heard the phone ring.
I thought he might come.
Are you OK? "I'm fine!"
I want to go to Sweden.
I will stand by you whatever happens.
I want you to open the window.
The workers are against the new plan.
Never speak ill of others behind their backs.
We enjoy reading books.
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.
You ran as fast as you could.
She is always at the bottom of the class.
She will make a fine match for my son.
You're one of them too, aren't you?!
I guess I should get home to my wife.
None of them could understand what she was implying.
I led him by the hand.
The world is small.
He walked along the street.
Man up!
Tom eats the same food day in and day out.
I was very scared of snakes.
Go out of the room at once.
I don't know how I did it. What's important is that I did it.
He has been ill in bed for four days.
He talks as though he knew everything.
Her whole body hurt.
Which is the most difficult language in the world?
The history of China is older than that of Japan.
Tom couldn't find anybody to go with him, and so he went by himself.
I think it's strange that he didn't speak to you.
What are you planning on doing?
She lives in an apartment alone.
Have you forgotten about me?
There is no sense in standing when there are seats available.
She loved her children alike.
How did she ever pass the test?
I never thought I'd see her there.
We will never know.
He looked in all directions, but didn't see anyone.
Which of you came here first?
Thank you very much for attending.
I have neither time nor money for that.
She asked him for help.
He is writing a letter.
It isn't raining much this year.
This too shall pass.
I'm okay.
Tom should do the same.
It's clear that he doesn't want to talk to me.
He acted like he owned the place.
I'm sorry I didn't reply to you sooner.
We had a good deal of rain last summer.
We have had much rain this summer.
Do you see him often?
Either you or I am wrong.
He likes strange animals, such as snakes.
I can't raise my right arm.
I must hurry to class.
I have expected his death for six months.
Could you please explain what's going on here?
Open an account.
What sort of things do you do on weekends?
Whoever doesn't know a foreign language doesn't know their own.
I like the Occitan language.
Bill lives near the sea.
This can't be!
Must I hurry?
He was very tall and thin, with long arms and legs.
He did it for his sister.
Language schools suck.
He said the truth.
Sadness never ends, hapiness do.
Both my parents are at home now.
I want to be better.
You shouldn't say that kind of thing when children are around.
To see is to believe.
Shall we go together?
I have black eyes.
I'll tell you everything about it.
What did you do today?
I can't figure out why he did it.
I explained the rule to him.
I'd like to live in Italy.
It isn't anywhere near as hot today as it was yesterday.
If anyone can do it Bill can.
What he said could possibly be true.
The water in this river is very clean.
How much is a room?
Nancy, here's a letter for you.
I never read that book.
Can I sit beside you?
I want to know if you'll be free tomorrow.
We got into his car and went to the sea.
Tom certainly won't get my vote.
Sundays I don't go to school.
It is doubtful whether we shall be able to come.
Your parents ought to know it.
You should read many books when you are young.
Give me the reason for which you were absent yesterday.
We must follow the rules of the game.
She's mature enough to bear a child.
He believes that he is a hero.
Can money buy happiness?
Are you ready to do that?
My enemy's enemy is my friend.
He is kind to her.
It is easy for you to solve this problem.
You have never been to Okinawa, have you?
There's no air on the moon.
Monday is a tough day.
Fred is going to Europe on Monday.
This chair is light.
He lives in an apartment.
I did all I could do.
Where are you going?
I know him but I don’t know his name.
I don't know because I wasn't there.
I don't know how I should do it.
I don't know exactly when I will be back.
I know you don't care.
I'm not prepared for this.
He had already gone.
His words are meaningless.
These letters, in the main, are from my mother.
These cars are big.
He seems hungry.
He seems hungry.
That plane is enormous!
Tom doesn't even know I exist.
I've been waiting for this day to come.
I've been waiting for this day to come.
There never was a good war nor a bad peace.
This is what I thought.
She pretended that she was sick.
I'm feeling fine now.
I know myself very well.
Whatever happens, I ain't telling nobody about it.
How would you feel if your wife left you?
I don't know because I wasn't there.
A true friend would've helped me.
I haven't seen Bill for a long time.
Has Father come home yet?
It was easy for him to solve the problem.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.
I haven't eaten yet.
My son still believes in Santa Claus.
What were you doing that moment?
He is famous as a doctor.
He is famous as a doctor.
What did you do last night?
Whoever comes first will get the best seats.
That is the woman who wants to see you.
She is just as beautiful as her mother.
What a man you are!
True love does not exist!
Let's leave as soon as he gets back.
I've slept well all night.
Five years have gone by since my father died.
His aim is to become a doctor.
This book seemed hard to read to me.
Ask him when the next plane will be.
I learned French instead of German.
Tell me when he returns.
I truly loved her.
Everyone knows his name.
Give me some time to think.
I have written a letter.
He noticed straight away.
He is a stranger to fear.
Of course I will go.
His house was out of the way.
Tom wants to buy some books.
Don't run, walk slowly.
Listen!
She took me by the hand.
He must love you.
Sorry, I'm a stranger here.
My father went to China.
English is my mother tongue.
I'm not a doctor.
The old man is above ninety.
I'd like you to go there.
How long ago was this?
He's as strong as a horse.
He asked me if I had slept well the night before.
Kenichi Matsuyama's acting is very good.
Is he a doctor?
My parents live in Kyoto.
Can you come on Sunday evening?
The sun comes and goes.
Who wrote that book?
What's my doctor's name?
I am a French doctor.
He's got enough money to buy a house.
We went to Barcelona.
Don't go too far ahead of us.
He is reading a book in his room.
I'd like to leave feedback.
I've always wanted to travel through Europe.
He's in a bad mood.
There exists only one possibility now.
They took every possibility into consideration.
I have a pain in my chest.
There are not many books on these shelves.
She decided to quit her job.
A rash appeared on his face.
The air felt a little cold.
Tom did all he could do.
How was your stay?
What's my room number?
They're afraid of him.
Don't drink too much, okay?
It seems that something has happened.
What're you doing tonight?
I told him to come.
I told him to come.
Jack resembles his father.
Don't let anybody see you.
Would you mind buying me some bread, please?
We'll leave without him.
No other girl in my class is prettier than Linda.
If I were you, I wouldn't do this.
I'll visit whenever I can.
That's it. I'm outta here.
Money will do anything.
I just got your letter yesterday.
I wanted to stay there two days longer.
What are you going to play?
Tom has told me a lot about you.
They don't teach you that in school.
He told me where to go.
I could not remember his name for the life of me.
We must think about friends.
Who were you speaking to on the phone?
She didn't have much money.
I don't know his real name.
I thought he would come soon.
Who told the story to you?
I will do it because she said.
I'm not even sure if that would help or not.
He can also speak Russian.
We often compare Japan with Britain.
It's worth a fortune.
You understand, right?
It's raining hard outside.
He's got an uncle who works in a bank.
Why?
Who am I? Where do I come from? Is there life after death? What is the meaning of life on earth?
I would like to live in a castle.
Then I don't want it, I reply.
Tom is a total nutcase.
No thank you, I don't need a plastic bag.
The future and the past are alike.
Where is Mississippi?
You have seen Tokyo Tower, haven't you?
The clock does not run.
Did you know you are stronger than you think you are?
The money on the table isn't mine.
What do you do in your free time?
What do you do in your free time?
What languages do you know?
Lead the way.
You drive.
Christopher Columbus discovered America.
I went there dozens of times.
You have one mouth and two ears, so listen more and speak less.
I don't feel much like talking right now.
I'm the best.
I'm afraid to go alone.
Do you know this part of the city very well?
I owe him 10 dollars.
I started working for this company last year.
I like your eyes!
She believes whatever he says.
The baby can stand but can't walk.
I don't know where you're from, and neither does he.
Look at the cat.
I don't know where you're from, and neither does he.
What do you think he has in mind?
This road will lead you to the station and the city center.
My younger brother is taller than I am.
Don't get yourself killed.
What happened afterwards?
I don't think she would understand it.
How many nights do you intend to stay here for?
Isn't that so?
John became a policeman.
Is this a river?
I never for a moment imagined that you would show my letter to Tom.
She was more beautiful than all of the others.
I want to see them again.
He is afraid of death.
It's Sunday. He can't have gone to school.
The man reading a book over there is my father.
So?
You're going to leave for London next Sunday, aren't you?
Tom is a man of his word.
Would you mind opening the window?
We cannot live without air and water.
Neither is beautiful.
We need rules!
She will become a doctor in two years.
This isn't as easy as it looks.
I only want what's best for everyone.
The man kept talking for an hour.
She talked as if she were my mother.
You are a good cook, aren't you?
That gentleman must be a doctor.
Make coffee.
Without water, we cannot exist.
She looks like her mother.
We had a little water.
He can't cook very well.
Strong as an ox.
She hasn't forgotten these rules.
I don't know what we would do without you.
He is to come here at five.
I consider you my friend.
Communications are down.
Somebody needs to stop you.
Now, it's your turn.
I've done my part.
You are the only one who can help me.
I've done my part.
Tom helped you to your feet.
I can't understand what you're saying.
He is a good doctor.
Don't make fun of him because he cannot write his name.
I don't need anybody.
Oh, I was ill.
Oh, I was ill.
You should get to school.
I'll be right with you.
Tom gave a very long speech yesterday.
I don't know what we would do without you.
You see some trees in front of the school.
When will you come?
Where did you get on this bus?
We really didn't know; we won't do it next time.
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same thing.
The matter has not been settled yet.
What's the local time in Tokyo now?
I wasn't supposed to tell you that.
Why are you telling me all this?
Be my Valentine.
What is the relationship between politics and war?
I know the reason that she quit her job.
I'm so tired that I can't go on.
I don't believe I'll do that.
I want to tell you something strange.
The newborn got a beautiful name.
The Shinanogawa river is the longest river in Japan.
You must do as you are told to do.
You should not do such a thing.
The older she grew, the more beautiful she become.
The two brothers have died.
They love their children.
After a while, the man came into the room.
He can run fast.
Come on! Quickly!
I'll stand by you no matter what happens.
Finally, he achieved his goal.
Why did he come here?
She had achieved her objective.
Are you coming home for dinner tonight?
I needed just that.
I know what he did.
I want you to be here.
You can't stay in here all day.
What can you do?
Tom didn't want to talk about that over the phone.
My body aches all over.
Glad to meet you!
I've never been better.
Have you received the letter?
What was it that brought you to me?
Tom comes here almost every Saturday.
That car is hers.
I am planning to go to Europe next week.
Run away!
The problem is that Nancy doesn't go to the club meetings.
She loves the boy as if he were her own child.
Tom became a hero.
You shouldn't do his work.
I don't believe they understood.
He will get back from school by five.
I wish Tom was here.
I can't necessarily agree with you on that point.
I would give it to them.
Tell me what you did in Hawaii.
There's no way I'll continue this conversation.
You never told me a single thing about this.
I'd like you to help me.
Everybody had a good year.
I'm living in Kunming at the moment.
Somebody wrote my name on the wall.
My brother is waiting for me at the school.
If you need anything, just gimme a holla.
Excuse me, but could you show me the way to the station?
I watched Doraemon a lot when I was a kid. But I had no idea he was so large!
He can't answer their questions.
I forgot to write to my parents.
I'd like to see my parents.
She'd like to find the purpose of life.
He likes to live in that place.
Return to your seat.
Those two will always be together.
She came home in low spirits.
It's your fault.
Everything is clear.
They say Tom is gone.
At 2:00 a.m. he finally found the solution.
We all want a new car or a new phone.
This was a few weeks ago!
Is your baby sleeping?
They kept quiet so that they would not be found.
The soldier gave me water.
I still haven't decided.
Do I exist?
Did you see a doctor?
Let me introduce you to my parents.
My mother's feeling better.
Tom doesn't think that's going to happen.
Tom doesn't think that's going to happen.
We have three meals a day.
People were not prepared for the storm.
Explain it once more, Jerry.
Some of them are my friends.
The boy came back.
The boy came back.
The boy came back.
That's against the rules.
She has fine features.
Tom eats less than you might think.
This is a book about England.
You should not go alone.
Children need love.
Let's drop the subject.
She showed me her room.
Keep going straight.
Keep going straight.
He has a head on his shoulders.
I don't believe him at all.
Is it the truth?
Keep going straight.
He belongs to the soccer club.
He had long hair.
The taxi has arrived.
And what are we going to do?
You're really too kind.
But you like it!
Let your uncle think about it.
Where did you buy these shoes?
I don't enjoy his society.
I had trouble with this question.
I can do it if you give me a chance.
Tom eats a lot.
The cause of his death was a car accident.
They remained in Tennessee.
My period hasn't come.
I had my first period when I was 13 years old.
My house is built of wood.
I'm really sick of life.
This coffee is undrinkable.
I was barely able to work.
Whatever I have is yours.
It was me who killed Kennedy.
He was covered with mud.
A dog was running after a cat.
We are doctors.
I put the plan into practice.
Call an ambulance!
Can you please tell me where the restaurant is?
She will come here before long.
That's a pretty hard question to answer.
He didn't say a single word in reply.
What are you doing next Sunday?
I am going to my room, where I can study.
I often read manga in my spare moments at work.
He often writes to his parents in Japan.
You like English, don't you?
She cannot be over twenty.
I shouldn't have done it.
Where's the boy?
Where is the boy?
Tell me what you have in mind.
Tell me what you have in mind.
There's something wrong with the phone. I can hardly hear you.
He visited Kyoto last year.
Don't be a dick.
How is one able to sleep inside an airplane?
What was going on?
What was going on?
She is all right at the moment.
She decided to marry him.
My mother was busy cooking dinner.
Tom should've known better.
He demanded that John should go there.
We believe in God.
Every boy and girl is taught to read and write.
This machine is superior in quality to that one.
She got away from us by walking slowly.
Tom doesn't know what happened.
You are not consistent in your actions.
I got it for nothing.
We study English at school every day.
The sky will soon clear up.
This book is really old!
No one other than you knows how to make such a tasty salad.
I found her cat in an empty room.
The girl doesn't know how to do it.
I don't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
He probably won't come.
My father left me a large inheritance.
My legs still hurt.
When I saw him last, he was still a child.
Tom took a hard hit.
I need that phone.
Yoko will go to Kyoto next week.
Do you know how to play mahjong?
Without air we would die.
She’s a doctor now.
She’s a doctor now.
He is eating.
You seem to be a kind man.
I will do it at the first opportunity.
None of the children are sitting.
She asked him to sit down.
We sent for a doctor.
They are my old friends.
All I can do is wait.
She was intelligent as well as beautiful.
I can't understand his feelings.
Yumi has many books.
My mum likes tea very much.
Tom wasn't afraid of death.
Too much drinking will make you sick.
The whole nation wants peace.
You will love your neighbour as you love yourself.
I will be at the meeting.
I don't want to go to school today.
Tom xeroxed the document.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Her new hair-do made her look younger.
The doctor just tells me when to take each medicine.
I can't die here.
Please, leave it to me.
Please, leave it to me.
Bring me a piece of chalk.
Everything had happened so quickly.
He is always asking for money.
I remember your face, but I don't remember your name.
It's clear from his actions that he loves her.
These books are very old.
My mother loves me.
What to do next is the question.
Is there a cat on the table?
You shouldn't wait here.
You’ll be killed!
He is known as a rock singer.
They'll come at five o'clock?
I can easily touch my toes.
Will she go to the United States next year?
Paul is sick in bed today. "That's too bad."
We agreed to the plan.
If anyone can do it, it's you.
Believe in yourself.
This cake is very delicious.
The trees were very scarce.
He is due to arrive tomorrow.
I'll never leave you.
A fox came along.
Do you have any plans for tomorrow evening?
She was lying face down on the bed.
I'm going to kill him.
The old man is very kind.
I want you to stay here longer.
Ken runs faster than you.
The meeting had 12 attendees.
Imagine that you have a wife.
Everything is on schedule.
He's giving it a go.
Take a whiff.
Father never hits me on the head.
Does it snow much here in winter?
The book is about the law.
What activity do you spend most of your time doing?
He lives just across the road.
I have come to Japan not to teach but to write.
Tom is currently working on that problem.
I'm still on duty.
I did not hear you.
Normally, we eat three times a day.
He may be the very man that I need.
All I have is a book.
I want to be like Picasso.
Would you mind coming with me?
She has large breasts.
He lives near my house.
I've done my part.
Communications are down.
Five years have passed since I came to Japan.
It is especially hot today.
She has two uncles; one lives in Kyoto and the other in Osaka.
How fast she is running!
I saw a man's face in the window.
It's cheaper to take the bus.
I received a letter in English yesterday.
Since when you have been here?
Someone saved my life.
We went to her rescue.
I am going to start.
Someone came ten minutes ago.
It was difficult to tell if Tom was in his room.
Would you explain it again?
I am on medication.
I have to tell her the truth tomorrow.
Why were you there?
Different people believe in different things, but there is only one truth.
It was cold that day, and moreover it began to rain.
He is so old that he cannot walk quickly.
No matter what you say, I don't think Tom is a nice guy.
I told her that she was right.
Mother told me to behave myself.
If I were you, I wouldn't do that kind of thing.
Perhaps he knows this story.
Where have you gone?
I am tired of listening to his long speech.
My uncle lives in London.
He won't tell me what happened.
Nobody does that.
She didn't have a brother.
This young man has blue hair.
My brother sent me a letter last week.
I didn't know the city, and what's more, I couldn't speak a word of the language.
As long as you keep quiet, you can stay in this room.
What's your favorite game?
Tom didn't have to yell at me.
It would be good if I had a car.
How do you feel now?
You're the tallest one.
Yesterday was a good day.
He died of cancer.
Is it clear?
Tom is the tallest in his class.
She lay in bed all the time.
You can do it however you like.
It’s quite possible.
Maybe it'll snow.
I may do that.
I've never heard of that city.
Please let us know.
Is this possible?
Look at this high mountain!
This dog is yours. Where is mine?
I went to Kawagoe by taxi.
I was born with twelve fingers.
Christ died once for all humans.
I'm just not feeling up to it right now.
He's a good bloke.
Join us, won't you?
Is there something we can do?
He's tall.
I'll be in bed by the time you get home.
Tom ran as fast as he was able to.
Tom was deployed to Iraq.
I couldn't get it.
New York is a huge city.
About one hundred and fifty dollars altogether.
How long do I have to wait?
I can't disagree with you on that.
He didn't attend the meeting.
Thousands of men were on their way to Washington.
Sometimes, accepting help is harder than offering it.
I couldn't get it.
Don't trust, don't be afraid, don't ask!
Brothers in arms are brothers for life.
Do you like this city?
Everything that can go wrong will go wrong.
I'm crazy about him!
We have had more snow than usual this winter.
The person in question is now staying in America.
I can not buy spare parts for this car.
Tom didn't feel like waiting.
John is mad about pop music.
How did you do this?
This box is twice as large as that one.
You'd better go home at once.
What the hell are you doing?
Who is the boy?
I'll accept it, but with one condition.
You know very well how it happened.
What we should do next is the question.
Tom is our guest.
Quick, run after him.
He is the heaviest of us all.
All Jack does is sleep.
Tom never talks about his work.
She needs help.
I'm going to give Emi a new CD.
You can't do that here. In fact, you aren't allowed to do that anywhere.
Please visit as soon as you get into town.
I am still waiting to be told what happened.
There are more than seven thousand languages in the world.
I didn't say this!
He was absorbed in the book.
Who did you give the book to?
He was 12 years old when he came to live with us.
Anyone can do it easily.
Why have I done it?
There's no but about it!
A friend told me that story.
I've got everything under control.
How many people are in this room?
Show me how it works.
I've been thinking about the meaning of life.
I have just written a letter to him.
He is a different person from the one we are looking for.
He ran.
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night.
It's a pity that you don't know that.
Tom asked for the check.
If that happened, what would you do?
What are friends for?
He said "Yeah" when she asked if he was tired.
I'm in debt to my uncle for $10,000.
His speech was too short.
He can not have gone to school.
I can't buy it because I don't have any money.
You had better ask him how to do it.
Easy isn't always simple.
That wall is cold.
Where's the bakery?
I don't think that she will come.
I want to know the reason.
Fear is a great motivator.
You must think of your family.
Tom isn't himself today.
He stood gazing at the painting.
I don't understand what he said.
Please excuse me, I have to leave.
There are no tickets left.
She tried several times but failed.
We're having a three-day weekend this week.
He is a doctor, but also a writer.
Answer my questions.
Thank you all very much.
Everybody was laughing.
My job is easy and I have a lot of free time.
How long do I have to stay here?
Eat your food.
Tom decided to drop out of school and work full-time.
She left without saying even a single word.
I waited for the answer but nobody answered.
If you don't like it, then don't eat it.
Your lips are red.
Mt. Fuji is Japan's tallest mountain.
Fuck your mom.
The war is liked by only those who haven't seen it.
I suppose her brother would be about forty when he died.
Why didn't you come yesterday? I waited a long time for you.
He likes reading books.
It's all I can do.
Let's face the reality!
Tony and I played together yesterday.
What he is saying doesn't make sense.
Children like playing outside.
At first, I thought he was sick.
This isn't my book.
I asked him to do that.
He died one year ago.
Would you like me to do that work?
Where is there a telephone?
One year later, Paul was born.
Friday is near.
This will be his car.
I wrote my name on the paper.
He is the only person that can do it.
She asked me how long ago my parents died.
Tom was able to answer all the questions.
You finally succeeded in getting a job.
I make it a rule to read before going to bed.
A car stopped at the entrance.
There are four schools in this town.
I've heard this story scores of times.
I will be waiting for you in my room.
Are you feeling sick?
For what purpose?
He never recovered from the death of his son.
Let's just begin.
Sit down.
Tom is acting like a child.
It tastes very good, doesn't it?
He didn't come, because he was sick.
Tom has already made up his mind.
He raised his hands.
People believe what they see.
I have read this book before.
He drew $100 from his account.
How come you know so much about Japanese history?
If I had had enough money, I would have bought the book.
I don't believe one word of it.
Where do I have to change trains?
You'd better go in person.
My sister is younger than me.
Might makes right.
I can do this myself.
They stayed friends.
Today is the best day of my life.
I want to see him at all costs.
I'll do it, but there's one condition.
We must be ready for anything.
Answer me, please.
I'm to blame.
This is a very old book.
How does she do this?
Yesterday she smiled at me.
I can't see what you mean.
I don't know what we'll do.
But you will write, won't you?
This conversation has never occurred. "What conversation?"
Has he come yet?
He gave me all the money he was carrying with him.
This work has to be finished by Monday.
Any time.
Yeah, I want you to do it.
That's all right. I understand you. You speak very well.
Everybody laughs at me!
Your hair's beautiful.
I don't think it's strange at all.
It was apparent that there was no way out.
I wish I were in Paris now.
What do you usually wear to work?
The brother wrote a letter to the sister.
She says she will come.
I sometimes write to my mother.
What an awful lot of books you have!
You must quit drinking.
Where did you leave your shoes?
Your book is double the size of mine.
My father died four years ago.
He threw a stone at the dog.
You came alone today?
You came alone today?
This is not mine.
Why did you do this?
This is the letter written by Mr. Brown.
He is reading a book in his room.
I'll come now.
I believed that he was a physician.
Will you go?
He decided not to wait any longer.
I wish I were clever.
Don't play with fire.
Tell me what that man is like.
There's never enough time to do everything you want to do.
I killed a god.
We need rules.
Few people know about the plan.
Tom is a close friend of mine.
Please tell me what I should do.
Fate smiled upon me.
Keep your hands above the table.
John did not know how to explain to his wife that he had quit his job.
Don't tell Father about this.
I plan to go to France next year.
You run.
I've asked him to stay.
I will make a man out of you.
There's very little paper left.
Do as I say.
Maybe they will come and maybe they won't.
Tom was here just a moment ago.
Tom didn't want to talk about it.
What about?
She didn't know what to do.
He put the book on the shelf.
Children play in this park every day.
I have not seen him for about three months.
Now it is his turn.
Eat as much as you like.
Is it about ten o'clock?
The game's almost over.
You should spend 40 minutes on this task.
I wish I was young again.
He will be here all evening.
He ought to have arrived in New York by now.
Which game shall we play next?
What do you think he meant by that?
He is not as tall as his brother.
Were you here last week?
No, it cannot be true.
I wish I had a room of my own.
We call him Mike.
Don't ask me why.
That wasn't my fault.
Go ahead with your story.
My bet is that John will get the job.
Fortunately, the weather was good.
It is neither good nor bad.
He abandoned his family.
Do as you're told to do.
No matter the age, a child is a child.
Do I have to take this medicine?
I found my shoes.
Do turtles have teeth?
Please keep in touch.
He came by car.
His wife died in childbirth.
Will you tell me the truth?
In any case, I'll have to go there tomorrow.
My father died ten years ago.
Please leave.
He got up at eight in the morning.
Without his wife's money, he would never be a director.
Please do not forget.
I won't go to school tomorrow.
I left home without having breakfast yesterday.
He looked into her eyes.
We must go to school.
Do your best in everything.
Such a thing can't happen in Japan.
He was afraid of being laughed at.
He must not live.
Where is Room 105?
This is the only book I have.
Oh! Show it to me please.
Where should I put it?
This medicine will take the pain away.
He went together with her.
What've you been doing all this time?
Alone against everybody.
Pretend you're me.
Tom is a very clever boy.
I have been silent for a long time.
I'm the best.
He is very sick.
I have not asked for help, nor do I desire it.
You are so tall!
I felt the same way.
I don't know what he's trying to say.
There was no response to my question.
Who is this woman?
What a tall tree it is!
He pretended not to know the answer.
He pretended not to be listening.
There is a school near my house.
Oleg always answered the questions quickly.
I'll tell you a story.
I will never tell it to anybody.
Put it back where you found it.
Watch your mouth or you'll get it.

When they look at the forest, they don’t see the trees.
He is no longer a boy.
I sat down next to her.
She didn't show up.
I'll go myself.
He is my close friend.
He can come.
No boy in the class is as tall as Bill.
I ran after the sun.
I cannot find a solution. Help me.
The boy bought a dog.
I bought the book for ten dollars.
He is taller than any other boy in his class.
She smiled at him.
I don't get what you mean.
What would you have me do?
This is not your book, it's mine.
He is a doctor and an author.
Give it to her.
Raise your hand.
Raise your hand.
Do not do this.
What are your thoughts on this?
She looked up at the sky.
He had no luck in finding work.
Is this your son, Betty?
He gave her a book.
Please go and see who it is.
She wanted me to come.
This wall is taller than that one.
Soon gotten soon spent.
Where are your parents?
Open your mouth wide.
I do not need money now.
Pierre, come here!
I like your way of smiling.
I recognized him at first glance.
Who is the tallest of all?
Tell me the correct answer.
What do you want to do today?
Some people eat sushi with their hands.
How could this happen?
Well, possibly you're right.
I can't get up.
It was rainy yesterday.
I can't tell you the answer to that yet.
Do you really think it's bad?
He is really a queer fellow!
I'm talking on the phone.
Only my mother understands me.
Take it easy.
I will stay at your place for some days.
Do you have any siblings? "No, I'm an only child."
I want to buy the same watch as Jack has.
What's happening to you?
What were you doing?
Her father died.
What's in this box?
Why is she here?
I'd rather stay than go.
Where's his book? "It's on the table."
I know who lives in this house.
Where to go?
One of us has to do it.
Who is this letter from?
He is stronger than ever.
You're right.
I'm not always free on Sundays.
Do it as soon as possible.
What does he say in his letter?
The boy doesn't know how to behave.
Is this really possible?
I asked Ken to help me.
I will start after he comes.
Tom need not go to school today.
I would do anything to get a job.
Do we exist?
Who's in charge here?
You mustn't tell that to your parents.
Mr Yamada, you are wanted on the phone.
He returned from Canada.
At first, it is difficult.
I'll love you for the rest of my days.
He can do both at the same time.
We must work faster.
That day shall come.
At seven I'll be back.
She asked me, can I read and write.
Are those your books? "No, they aren't."
I believe in the life beyond.
I enjoy watching children play.
I often read.
Tom was there, too.
We'll learn the truth soon.
That was just the beginning.
She didn't like her husband.
He doesn't know it yet, but he's already dead.
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?
He achieved his goal.
You are probably wrong.
You can't write "Pfirsichbäumchen"? It's so simple!
Tom can't come to the phone right now.
What is that smell?
It's better as it is.
Don't laugh at him.
I'll be back soon. I have to run to the post office.
We must call a cat a cat.
No way!

It is beyond my power.

It is difficult for me to answer the question.
I'm glad I could help.
Tom died of cancer.
He lived there completely alone.
You are a bad boy.
I want to write a book.
Everything's all right now.
She didn't appear to recognize me.
For this reason I cannot agree with you.
Don't pussyfoot around the issue; do we have a problem, or don't we?
I know your older brother quite well.
Come to visit me.
Which will you take, this one or that one?
How did you spend your free time?
He acts like a rock star.
I've never done this in my life.
I'd like to know exactly how much money is in my account.
I changed trains at Ueno Station.
I'm sorry to hear this.
You can believe me.
He is indifferent to what others say.
Here goes nothing.
Mother has old-fashioned ideas.
Where did you stay?
I'll tell you my story.
I still want to go.
She is my best friend.
Exactly!
Don't believe him.
I wish I had much money.
He went away without saying a word.
We went to school by bus.
He's your father.
He will come back at four.
I'm tall.
What would you do if another war occurred?
Did he tell you what to do?
I think I did something wrong.
May I use your car, Dad?
Why am I laughing?
The sky cleared up.
Where did you buy this book?
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
Look at me!
Tell me what to do.
They achieved their goal.
She called him by name.
He solved the problem by himself.
No one knew how to answer the question.
Our restaurant is better than that restaurant.
I bought this book for myself, not for my wife.
Let's see. I bought it last week.
It could've been worse.
My friend sent me a letter asking how I was.
You shouldn't say that kind of thing when children are around.
You shouldn't say such a thing in the presence of children.
I know no one in this city.
Will you go, too?
I recognized him immediately.
What do you really think of him?
Thank you, I finally understand.
I never would have thought that I would meet you here.
Are there still enough chairs for everyone?
We talked about various things.
Did you decide?
You know, in general, it's all fucked up here.
What exactly am I paying for?
She liked men, if truth were told, a tiny wee bit more than women.
He was crying.
That's why you're the best.
That's why you're the best.
I got to know her REAL well.
This way.
I don't work on either Saturday or Sunday.
We will be back tonight.

Let's hit the road.
We need money.
Any book will do.

I have lived here a little over 60 years.
You killed my father.
You killed my father.
You killed my father.
Big deal!
Nobody believed him.
I have two conditions.
They were in the right place at the right time.
She came up to me and asked my name.
Where do we come from? Who are we? Where are we going?
Tom doesn't have to go to school today.
So where were you?
I think love doesn't exist.
I will ask him about it tomorrow, then.
I reckon that I'm right.
I think I'm right.
I don't know what kind of person he is.
This is my wife.
I don't want to hear that.
Everything was lost.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
She has got long hair.
I speak a few languages.
It was his decision.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
She told him that her father had died.
I don't need them.
It's impossible for me to explain it to you.
Did you get my letter?
This moment will be recorded in history.
What are you talking about!?
She can count from one to ten.
Can you imagine the world without money?
Tom is the only person who can help me.
Tom couldn't say a word.
She needs the money.
I couldn't remember his name.
What kind of man was he?
It seems to me better without the quotation marks.
You don't have to believe me.
She is afraid of cats.
No work is as hard as the one you don't like to do.
Great was the sorrow of her parents.
My son is ten years old.
Let me speak.
I need you.
I'm not your slave.
I can't explain what happened.
He cut the nose off.
Which of them is your brother?
All the people who were here have left.
As if!
It is time to go to school.
I have been reflecting on what you said to me.
I'll take this one.
Oh, Tom, take me with you!
You didn't come at four. That's why they went without you.
Tom arrived earlier than usual yesterday.
The end is near.
She is as intelligent as he.
Where were we?
What were we talking about?
Forget about her.
Tom wanted to sleep under the stars.
Rain or shine, I will go.
I hear you are good at cooking.
Visit us tomorrow.
I did my work.
Work is due to begin tomorrow.
Tom and only Tom can do it.
Tom and only Tom can do it.
He was underwater for three minutes.
He can scarcely write his name.
Stay at home.
Stay at home.
I'd like to sit by the window.
I'd like to sit by the window.
I will be right back!
He plays very well.
Do you have one a little smaller?
Who killed her?
This isn't mine. "It's not mine either."
Your problem is similar to mine.
She has no real friends.
Although I was exhausted, I continued to work.
I cannot understand it.
I've noticed that.
He is not scared of snakes at all.
She was caught red handed.
My uncle gave me his car.
Don't come.
It's not a game.
I'd like to reserve a seat.
She will have to cook for everyone.
I will go on ahead.
One of the two of us has to do it.
I won't go there again.
This is a bow for a strong person.
I've been there once.
Think before opening your mouth!
I've been there once.
My sister will go to Tokyo next year.
He didn't know what to do next.
I don't have the time to read this book.
Did you get his letter?
This desk is better than that one.
She speaks ten languages.
She did it again.
Here's to you!
My mother has four brothers.
He has a photographic memory.
He asked me where my uncle lived.
Why can't you take things just as they are?
It was harder than I thought.
Are they coming, too?
Don't even think about it.
We prefer to stay here.
Everyone was silent.
Please make way for him.
He writes letters to his mother.
Nobody knows that, said the doctor.
I don't eat bread.
I've been thinking over the issue for a long time.
What on earth is the problem?
Raise your hand if you know the answer.
Japan today is not what it was even ten years ago.
What would your father think?
He went to Paris two years ago.
I can't go on.
I can't explain it.
Do you really want to know?
I wouldn't have said it like that.
I don't have any money and I don't have any friends either.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
I can't cook.
Get a life!
Does your sister work there?
I'm not good at Russian.
Five times five is twenty five.
Nobody came to my rescue.
It's sort of strange.
He's here for me.
Take it, or leave it.
You can't be a doctor.
Tom and Mary can't be in the same room.
I can't stay silent on this matter.
The night is dark.
They know what's happening.
I try to think.
I'll do my best.
I know I'm going to die.
Are all the books on the table?
I consider you one of my closest friends.
Tom is a golden boy.
The cat is under the table.
He was not able to open the box.
Where is the restaurant?
I've just come home.
Join in, try it out, do it better!
We should take into account she is still young.
We want to know the truth.
I showed him my room.
Did you have a good weekend?
He answered not a word to me.
I looked into his eyes.
To live at the end of the world.
He's unable to do that.
We did it.
Tell me about this girl.
It started again!
The dog follows me wherever I go.
The dog follows me wherever I go.
I'm afraid to go alone.
It was a great time for Hollywood.
Do you know what that means?
Is the wine red?
What've they done to you?
I still remember his name.
She doesn't like the way I speak.
You shouldn't have said such a thing to her.
How much do I owe you?
Spring ahead, fall behind.
I'm your brother.
In the evening, we will have some guests.
I'm your sister.
Nobody knows what's going on in my country.
I am getting strong.
It's more than enough.
She drank straight from the bottle.
Are you gonna pay for it?
Tom can't answer your question.
He knows the truth.
He lived in the center of London.
The night was so cold.
Swimming makes your legs strong.
I would like to tell you something.
I would like to tell you something.
I hear you wanted to see me?
You're right. I'll go by taxi.
We were right.
Nobody knows where he has gone.
Did you see what I did?
Did you see what I did?
Did you see what I did?
Did you see what I did?
Tom, I have the feeling we're speaking different languages. "Что ты сказала, Мэри?"
The house is too big for us, and what is more, it is too expensive.
Our baby isn't speaking yet.
His life is in my hands.
I'll do the work tomorrow.
I find it hard to understand him.
If you don't eat, you'll die.
Does that mean you won't come?
We are good friends.
We did what we were told.
How did we reach this point?
She doesn't answer any kind of letter.
I don't think that she looks like her mother.
Did you just realize that?
I left it on the table.
Are you going or staying?
Don't forget that.
It was the best night of my life.
It is probable that she will come tomorrow.
It's not worth reading any further.
There's no food left.
Do you want her to know about it?
Your brother wasn't at school today.
I'm still your friend.
Can you do it?
I am telling a story.
You're my hero.
You can't run away from your fate.
Is it my turn?
He is not so tall as you.
Have you ever been to Paris?
She doesn't smile for me anymore.
Do you need any money?
There's a call for you.
He works all night and he sleeps all day.
We didn't do that.
You know about that, don't you?
I'm fed up!
My back hurts.
He was sitting on the bed.
She's only two years old, but she can already count to 100.
All the dogs are alive.
Betty talks as if she knew everything.
I was speechless.
We need your help.
She doesn't want me to speak about this issue.
Did you do it by yourselves?
She wants to go.
It was so hot that I slept with the window open.
She's crazy about him.
Do you know where my old glasses are?
I need friends.
What's your native language?
Look at me.
Look at me!
This time it's my turn to pay.
Does Tom know who I am?
Do you think Tom is dead?
It happened in Rome.
I'm very tall.
I'm very tall.
He's a hero.
He needs you.
He needs you.
He needs you.
Why didn't you go to school today?
Am I going to die?
I heard voices.
I heard voices.
Tom is my hero.
Where's my car?
I'm a man.
I didn't know you could cook so well.
I didn't know you could cook so well.
I just opened it.
I just opened it.
I like your hair.
I love this part.
I love your eyes.
Drive on.
Why did you want to see me?
Why did you want to see me?
Why did you want to see me?
Take this medicine after meals.
I like English very much.
You'd better send for a doctor.
Tom isn't going to stay.
What happened after that?
His heart is sick.
He explained it to me.
Do you come here every day?
May I sit next to you?
Finally, I have my own car.
I don't like your friends.
Please explain the rule to me.
I know you considered me a close friend.
It was the best night of my life.
Did you have a nice weekend?
Her child behaves well.
I know exactly how you feel.
How many times do I have to tell you not to eat candy just before dinner?
That's really great!
He's taking a shower.
He always keeps his word.
I love you the most.
What has she done?
He made no response.
They're very close.
I want to go to Seattle.
He's angry at the world.
I want to see him.
I'm not eating this.
She didn't marry him of her own will.
She is the only friend I have.
Never will I see her again.
I saved your life.
Life is a long, long road.
Here is my heart.
Our native language is Japanese.
Tom has died.
Bring it here.
Are you tired of living?
He was wrong.
Solve the problem.
Solve the problem.
Can you come at ten on May second?
Can you come at ten on May second?
I feel very ill.
I feel very ill.
Tom was detained by the police.
Tom was detained by the police.
Bring all your money.
Bring all your money.
He and his wife tried to work out their problems, but couldn't.
Our children all go to the local school.
When will you go to Armenia?
Life without love is just totally pointless.
He gave it to me for nothing.
That incident made him famous.
Two years ago I went to China.
Two years ago I went to China.
I can't understand you.
I can't understand you.
You can do what you want.
I'll write you a letter.
I'll write you a letter.
I'm still alive.
Is he alright?
Is it good news?
Is this car new?
Isn't it enough?
They aren't afraid of death.
It may seem odd.
It was worth it.
You don't want to do that.
You don't want to do that.
Maybe next time.
Nobody wants it.
Please sit down.
The sea is calm.
They are yellow.
What did he see?
He did not listen.
I want to see that.
I just arrived now.
This book is very thick.
My house is your house.
Tom doesn't know my name.
Who's that girl?
I'm reading a letter.
I read a letter.
I like your friends.
America, here I come!
You probably want to be alone.
You probably want to be alone.
My time has not yet come.
I can see it in your eyes.
He didn't give me time to think.
You should eat more.
You have to be home by nine o'clock.
You have to be home by nine o'clock.
I know you're not scared.
He felt severe pain in his back and legs.
I think you're ready.
Tom was my hero.
There's no point in waiting.
What exactly do you want from us?
What exactly do you want from us?
What am I writing now?
Why couldn't you come yesterday?
Why couldn't you come yesterday?
The parents named the baby Akiyoshi.
The parents named their baby Akira.
He is one of my best friends.
What has Tom done?
What did Tom do?
What did you do?
Mother asked us why we had done that.
What's the word?
I talked with him about it over the telephone.
I talked with him about it over the telephone.
Is this your DVD?
She might come.
Everything has an end.
I had a tough day.
I've had a busy day.
Tom likes being alone.
When you're done with the book, put it back where you found it.
He asked me if I liked mathematics.
He asked me if I liked mathematics.
He asked me if I liked mathematics.
I was too tired to go on working.
I was too tired to go on working.
This road leads you to the station.
I have enough money.
I wrote a letter.
He was wounded in the shoulder.
You wanted me to get a job, so I did.
You wanted me to get a job, so I did.
After work I go straight home.
He wants to come.
You don't want to see this, do you?
She left school two years ago.
I have a wooden table.
He has many history books.
His nose bled.
I heard that story.
I have heard the story.
He was knee deep in mud.
I am afraid it will rain in the afternoon.
In every man there lives a little boy.
I wrote a letter to my mother last night.
I wrote a letter to my mother last night.
Please let me come with you.
Remington spent several months in Havana.
Nobody tried to help Tom.
Did they understand?
Tom has made his decision.
I need the money.
Stop acting like a child.
He was such a nice boy that he was loved by everybody.
What happened here?
No one died.
Don't you know his name?
Don't you know his name?
The doctor seized the patient's hand and said: "So how do you feel today?"
I'd like to know if that's true.
I didn't sleep last night.
I won't see him anymore.
It is three years since he died.
Be a good boy.
You probably don't want to talk to me.
Are you ready?
I think I'm going crazy.
I got your letter.
Everything was in order until he came.
Why are you asking about that?
I knew he would accept.
We need a car.
Don't try to do all these things at once.
Speak louder so everyone can hear you.
Some people believe in God and other people don't.
I made up my mind to go there.
This can't be what it looks like.
I recognize that what he says is the truth.
That is how it happened.
What a pity she can't come!
Give me that.
We will go but you won't.
We will go but you won't.
We will go, but without you.
I don't want to read this book.
Tom runs very fast.
There was a castle here many years ago.
Tom, I need your help.
Tell me what's going on.
I don't know exactly when I'll be back.
They told me about it.
I had a horrible dream last night.
Give me a white piece of paper.
Give me a white piece of paper.
I'm almost ready.
I'm afraid of death.
In Japan, all children go to school.
I remembered everybody.
I was in the mountains.
I'll be back in a moment.
Don't stay in the sun too long.
I've forgotten about her.
I've forgotten about her.
No one was to be seen on the street.
Today is a good day to die.
You want me to do your dirty work for you, don't you?
Whatever happens, I want you to know that I love you.
I won't have enough time for everything I want to do.
I was thinking we might want to help Tom financially.
I wanted to have a word with you about what happened.
Jim has broad shoulders.
I want to know what happened to the gun Tom gave you.
This is my favorite book.
You can't start over.
She named him Charles.
I've never heard the kind of stories he tells.
Tom wants to play.
Kosovo is the heart of Serbia!
Kosovo is the heart of Albania!
I thought I knew what I was doing.
The food's ready.
She was impatient to see her family.
Tom is sitting at his desk.
The eyes say more than thousand words.
The law is the law.
What happens now?
What happens now?
He's your friend.
Take no prisoners!
She mistook me for my brother.
Read this book.
Read this book.
We see what we expect to see.
You have only to answer the first question.
Get out of my house!
I must know the truth about her.
Jim stayed at my house.
What do you think about the president's speech?
Listen to what I am saying.
You can't just leave us here with no food and water.
We must sleep at least eight hours a day.
My right shoulder hurts.
Oh! Is it true?
Please come.
Stand up straight.
Stand up straight.
It can't be Tom.
She thinks that she's always right.
I'm tired of this.
I'm tired of this.
What did Tom know?
Which do you like better, the sea or the mountains?
Which do you like better, the sea or the mountains?
What do I owe Tom?
What do I owe Tom?
What're you eating?
What're you eating?
What are you thinking about? "I'm thinking about you."
I'll come on May 23rd.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
He became a handsome young man.
At first, I felt they were right to have fired me.
Do you believe that there is life after death?
He's almost as tall as me.
I don't understand it.
Think of your future.
You can't just go.
You can't just go.
My uncle died of lung cancer.
God knows where he has gone.
What've you been doing?
Why are you under the table?
Goodness knows what it was.
I feel something.
I think he will never come back.
You can use my car today.
Do you think this is some kind of game?
It's time for me to go.
Are you out of your mind?
I heard that she came here.
I don't like this book.
Can you do it in one day?
Do not do this.
Tom wants to know who did it.
She's already forgotten about you.
That couldn't be true.
Which chair did you put the book on?
Which chair did you put the book on?
I will see him after I get back.
Not a soul was to be seen in the town.
I've had a good time.
I had a good time.
This is a small book.
Will you really come?
You'd better leave.
I just want to go home.
I do feel pretty good.
I come here every day.
I know you're right.
Today is not your day.
A tree is green.
Bad news travels fast.
The sun is red.
The old man asked me the time.
What a question! Of course I love him.
I always counted you as a friend.
Was Tom alone?
I'm a completely new person since that night.
I just want to see what will happen.
I just want to see what will happen.
I am afraid he won't come.
Tom can't stay here alone.
I'm here not to look for happiness but to find it.
Won't you have some tea?
He was an honest man.
Bring me some water, and be quick about it.
We need a plan.
Could you show me the way to the station?
You should have been more careful.
You should have been more careful.
The earth is where we all live.
Tom is standing in the corner of the room.
It was cloudy that night.
This clock is mine.
Please open the bottle.
Please open the bottle.
She doesn't listen to him.
What was she doing in his room?
Where was he headed?
Help!
Where did everybody go?
He is not what he seems.
Do you want help?
Those glasses suit you.
Where do we go?
Where should we go?
Where will we go?
Believe it or not.
Believe it or not.
How late are you open?
She is around twenty years of age.
I asked him to help.
I might have left it on the table.
He comes here almost every day.
Stay here with us.
Stay with us.
Have I answered your question?
Have I answered your question?
This is my room.
He has two sons, I believe.
I haven't seen you for a while.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Didn't I tell you so?
There, now! What did I tell you?
Can you come at 9?
How did you manage to do that?
How did you manage to do that?
It was very hard.
It was really hard.
He's not a bad boy.
A true friend would not say such a thing.
How much is the most expensive car?
It's very difficult to understand him.
Does she work in this city?
He asked me if I knew her telephone number.
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
You're odd.
I read a book while I eat.
This is what we were talking about yesterday.
He told me about it.
What did you do in there?
What were you doing there?
Is it your car?
Is this your car?
I'm going to stay at home tonight.
He was all wrong.
Are you here on business?
He had a book in his hand.
I don't want to think about anything anymore.
He was warned several times.
What is your opinion on this matter?
Does that clock work?
She decided to be a doctor.
If I'll go or not, I still haven't decided.
If I'll go or not, I still haven't decided.
Please tell me the truth.
Please tell me the truth.
I want you to stay here with her.
Be prepared.
I am not your friend.
I'm no friend of yours.
I'm still at school.
I returned to Japan.
I need first aid.
Is her father alive?
Is her father alive?
Nobody loves war.
I wasn't even there.
Can you open the window?
You're not listening!
Keep your hands where I can see them.
They're about to leave.
That's what friends are for.
I'm not ready.
I'm very fat.
Tom wants to be your friend.
Your dinner is getting cold.
He's working on it.
Is that why you want to kill me?
What do you think happened here?
I wish I were as smart as you.
I'll never be back.
I don't think it's true.
You're the most beautiful woman in the world.
Did you have a good time?
Everything was better in the past.
You can go there.
So what's your problem?
It would be great if that were true.
My family is from Malaysia.
You didn't have to do that.
I want to know what you're doing here.
Where did you go?
Where's my stuff?
Did something happen at home?
Do you know where we're going?
Life without love has no meaning.
Soldiers bear arms.
The girl said that she had never heard of such a person.
I go to school at seven o'clock.
Could be, could be.
I do everything for my family.
Do you remember this game?
My sister showers every morning.
Sometimes they say: "I can't go to school. I'll go tomorrow".
I didn't ask for it.
I didn't ask for this.
I spoke to my parents.
I spoke to my parents.
My father isn't afraid of anybody.
I can't leave you.
I can't leave you.
That can't be.
That can't be.
I cannot run. My feet hurt.
But life is short!
It's hard to speak three languages.
He is too fat to run quickly.
Oh, you were at the hairdresser's.
I'll stand by you whatever happens.
He came.
Are you free this weekend?
I bought it for ten dollars.
I think Tatoeba is slow today.
We spent the day in the open air.
Did you hear that?
Come as fast as you can.
Tom was angry.
I won't see her anymore.
I didn't feel very well, but I went to work anyway.
I will now explain this rule to you.
I can't tell you yet.
Bring a couple more chairs.
She has long legs.
I know as little as you do.
These questions can be answered quite simply.
We named the cat Mimi.
Bill is my closest friend.
Good day, how are you?
She called her cat Tatoeba.
He has enough money.
Do you know what happened?
I think about you often.
You answer us first.
You answer us first.
His name is Kenji, but we call him Ken.
Do you remember this game?
Eat whatever you want.
If you don't want me to stay here, I'll leave.
They did what they were told.
Is it difficult to learn Greek?
The answer is yes.
I thought you had all the answers.
Do you have a solution?
I need you here.
Tom wasn't strong enough.
This is the first time I've ever smiled at Marika.
This is the first time I've ever smiled at Marika.
You can stay tonight with me.
Look at me in the eyes.
Where are you going?
I always get home by six o'clock.
I always get home by six o'clock.
You're going to be a mommy.
The book was published in 1689.
Am I my brother's keeper?
I just wanted to see what would happen.
When will he go home?
I like living in this country.
If possible, I'd like to go home now.
If possible, I'd like to go home now.
They aren't my books.
Sweden is the largest country in Scandinavia.
I'll do it tomorrow. "You said that yesterday!"
No one knows what has become of her.
Nobody knows what has become of him.
Put yourself in my place.
I want to get there by subway.
I just want to be his friend.
I just want to be her friend.
The days are longer in the summer.
It may seem strange.
But how can they do this?
I thought he wouldn't come.
She's good.
I don't understand why you want it.
She really wants to go.
She really wants to go there.
I wish we had more time.
My watch is less expensive than yours.
I have no great belief in my doctor.
I want to start making plans.
I would like to eat a hot soup.
Because he couldn't kill me, I killed him.
I took a cab to the station.
He writes often to his parents.
Are you going to be OK?
God died. We killed Him.
I have a pain in my chest.
I heard the bell ring.
My son wants to go to med school.
Are you staying there for the weekend?
I have no friends to play with.
Good morning! Where do you want to go?
May I have this book?
He took a taxi to get there in time.
Let's open the wine.
You arrived three days ago.
My brother wants to kill me.
Do you want to know how I did it?
How did your sister die?
Where are the other girls?
He lives on this street.
Man can live without friends.
She came to Tokyo with a view to getting a new job.
She wants him to be her friend.
First think, and then speak.
Friday is near.
What has he done to you?
What has he done to you?
Why does one say "Good day" when the day is not good?
The morning doesn't happen good.
Bit cold though.
I think you're ready.
I'd like you to come with us.
He is either in London or in Paris.
I need to use your phone to call an ambulance.
If I had known about it, I would have told you.
I just want to be near you.
Leave me.
I can't forget her.
Your hair is too long.
I can do it by myself!
Think of your family.
Think of your family.
This water tastes good.
I'd like to take a couple of days off next week.
What does your father do?
I don't care what they say.
Take whichever one you like.
Take whichever one you like.
I've got an appointment.
Steve was loved by all.
What do you do on Sunday?
This is an option to consider.
He showed her the way.
At last he reached his goal.
Is Mr. Brown a doctor?
How long will they stay?
It's difficult to understand why you want to go.
What is your name?
I don't believe God exists.
What's happened to you?
I'm not planning to work on Monday.
What are you going to do tonight?
Tell us the story from beginning to end.
She was too tired to go on working.
I want to know why this happened.
Why do you love me?
Forget it!
Forget it!
He's not a bad person.
He doesn't know English at all.
He answered all the questions in ten minutes.
When do you intend to start?
Life is very short.
How's school?
I want you to know what's true and what's not.
Are you ready?
You love your wife, right?
He has a Picasso.
What exactly do you want us to do?
I was there all the time.
Go and see for yourself what has happened.
Wait your turn.
This seems too good to be true.
I love my city.
Has someone died?
What do you think she is doing now?
He lay on his back.
It grew cold.
Tom picked the stuff up off the floor.
I don't see it.
I would like to know as well.
He's stronger than you.
Will you give me your telephone number?
He works from Monday to Friday.
Those who chase two rabbits at once will catch neither.
The book is easy.
Is this where you live?
Thank you for the help.
Thank you for the help.
Brace yourself.
Can you do it?
Did you know that?
They're right behind you.
It may occur at any moment.
Your dog is here.
There are a lot of books in his room.
He asked me to do it.
I have to do this by myself.
She must be sick.
He said that if he were there, he would help her.
Do you still need my assistance?
The answer is no.
I am not your enemy.
I'm good at mathematics.
Stand where you are or I'll kill you.
Are you ready to go?
I have a plan.
I have an ache in my arm.
If I had known about it, I would have told you.
I have a chest pain.
I can't sit down without pain now.
What animal is it?
I was not feeling well.
My heart sank into my boots.
Do you mean me?
She forgot to write him.
I'll leave when she comes back.
No, you can't.
Tom is eating.
Do you want me to leave?
He is a good writer.
That's how it was.
I want you to be my friend again.
Smile at me, please.
My life would have been completely empty without you.
They moved here three years ago.
I know your father very well.
That's what I've always said.
Jack is now either in London or Paris.
It may rain at any moment.
I've been seeking an answer to your question.
I've been seeking an answer to your question.
Who lives in this house?
What languages do you know?
You must be more polite.
I was glad to see him.
I was happy to see him.
As for me, I like this better.
If I were in your place, I would lend him a hand.
I would rather not go there alone.
You should start as early as possible.
Do you think I should go alone?
You should start as early as possible.
I like to answer this kind of question.
It doesn't make any sense.
He knows how to behave in public.
What are you thinking about? "Nothin'..."
What do you need this money for?
I got up.
Your house is three times as large as mine.
She's my older sister.
Tom didn't have enough money.
I did write to him.
I did so, not because I wanted to, but because I had to.
When I was a child, I was spanked if I did something wrong.
Although I was tired, I did what I was able to do.
I'm not in so great hurry.
The man asked me who I was, to which question I did not think it necessary to answer.
I am glad I did not buy such a thing.
No matter what I did, Ken wouldn't do what I told him.
I feel worse today than I did yesterday.
You're completely right!
I did say that, but I didn't mean it.
As I was sick, I did not go to school.
I did what I could.
That person asked me who I was, but I did not deem it necessary to answer him.
I'll tell you what I did today.
I'd just like to know what I did wrong.
I'd just like to know what I did wrong.
I don't know why I did that.
I don't know why I did that.
I did what I had to.
I did what I was told to do.
I can't remember the last time I did this.
I can't remember why I did that.
Tom is lying. I didn't do what he says I did.
Only I can do it. I did it alone.
I did write to him.
I did see him.
I did see him.
Not having seen her before, I did not know her.
Come to think of it, I did see Taro.
This is how I did it.
Yes, I did, he said.
I did not read a book yesterday.
I did the job to the best of my ability.
I did speak, but no one listened to me.
I did all the work myself.
I did so at his request.
I did it the way he told me to.
He rose to his feet and smiled at her.
We're surrounded by enemies.
I think that's a good idea.
Are airplane tickets expensive?
I thought I was losing my mind.
This is always the way it has been.
Fire!
I dislike being alone.
I dislike being alone.
All that you say is perfectly correct.
The law is still in effect.
Everybody laughed at me.
I was in Canada then.
I wasn't here then.
Do you want to go with me?
Those eyes say everything.
The first step is always the hardest.
What is your friend's name?
Should I leave?
I am weak in German.
She's really smart, isn't she?
Let's go, Ken.
Are you still in love with your wife?
I'll go first.
What's his name?
Your parents haven't seen you for a long time.
What does she think about my car?
That person thinks that my cat lives on the tree.
My cats aren't sleeping under the bed any more.
She is not my sister, she's my wife.
Because no man can speak my language.
Is that even possible?
Game over.
She is my friend.
I got up earlier than usual.
I got up earlier than usual.
You have a poor memory!
You've got a poor memory!
What to do next is our question.
The night was very still.
There's no wind here.
You should not go there.
It will probably rain.
Perhaps not.
Without water, the soldiers would have died.
Without air and water, nothing could live.
That person doesn't have any money at all.
My house doesn't have a roof.
Go back to bed.
Since it was raining, we stayed at home.
Few people think so.
He came to ask us for our help.
Please don't ask me.
You are not in a position to ask for anything.
I tried to help her.
There's no point for me to go to school.
He doesn't know the meaning of life.
Good morning. We have good weather today.
You'd better not go out in this cold weather.
I may write a letter for you.
Love is stronger than death.
Tom stood up and walked to the window.
I'm the only one who knows them.
He doesn't remember whether that room was empty or not.
Your room isn't empty any more.
He had to stay in bed.
She told me to open the window.
It is as hot a day as yesterday.
What became of him?
Your chair is identical to mine.
I don't have time to read books.
She looked him right in the eyes.
It'll rain soon.
I need some paper.
How's that possible?
I had never heard about Lviv before.
I can't do this.
Everyone noticed.
I went there because I wanted to.
Are we afraid of dying?
I have a feeling that she'll come today.
How tall you are!
No, not really.
Why are you not listening to me?
I always eat out.
The game is not worth the candle.
Finally, I found a job.
It's about to rain.
You're afraid?
You're afraid?
His word is law.
He goes there every day.
When was that?
I didn't notice Tom had gone.
The school is farther than the station.
Tom said he wanted some company.
I love your daughter.
I really don't need any help.
Do you need our help?
A room without books is like a body without a soul.
She's always kept these rules in mind.
Do it now.
He will explain it to you when he comes back.
Thank you for your letter!
Do you know where he went?
Do you know where he went?
Can you bring me the bill, please?
There's blood in the water.
Tom is afraid of dogs.
That's a hard question to answer.
It makes no fucking sense.
My father isn't home.
I'd like to see you tomorrow.
As soon as he went out of the house, it began to rain.
That's how it started.
Where should I sit?
He did what I told him to do.
I have to make a decision.
I'll explain how to take this medicine.
My brother has a good memory.
You look just like your older brother.
I'll accompany you.
I'll go along with you.
Her only hobby is collecting stamps.
No, I don't have it with me.
I can't tell you what Tom told me.
Let him stay home if he wants!
I know those women.
One should not make fun of others.
Tom shouldn't have said that.
It was his fault.
It was her fault.
Did you get her letter?
What happened to you last night?
Let me tell you everything I know.
I don't like it when she does that.
Things are only going to get worse.
Do you like to live in the country?
His dog follows him wherever he goes.
Please come again in three days time.
If my brother would have been there, he would have known what to do.
I saw a woman in black.
The room is empty.
That a boy!
Where is my newspaper?
She was alone with her baby in the house.
Just do that.
He always says the same thing.
We're not getting any younger.
This is true love.
I wrote to him for quite another reason.
Look straight ahead.
Look forward, please.
The line is busy again.
Please come again.
Nobody has come up yet.
I'd like to stay one more night. Is that possible?
These books are new.
These books are new.
It happened one night.
What he says has nothing to do with this problem.
Do you have anything to say regarding this?
This book is about China.
Put the book where you found it.
You'd better not go.
I'd like to see your sister.
I don't like the way he speaks.
I haven't eaten the soup and I won't.
It's past your bedtime.
His wife goes with him wherever he goes.
You had better not go there again.
You had better not go there again.
My tooth hurts.
She is very beautiful, and what is more, very wise.
You're not dead yet.
She raised her hand.
You'd better go home.
What do you like to do?
I can't tell you what we did last night.
Where will you put it?
Don't eat between meals.
Let's go to eat together.
If you want to hear a scary story, I'll tell you about a dream I had a few weeks ago.
He can read pretty well.
This house and this land are mine.
Where are your eyes?
Please show me this book.
The ice was thick enough for me to walk on.
He did what I wanted right away.
The trouble is that I am not equal to the work.
It's alive.
People laughed at him.
She didn't have any money, so she couldn't go with me.
Where did he go?
Let's go the extra mile.
What kind of help do you need?
Place it wherever you like.
Take this or that.
Take this or that.
This hotel is better than that hotel.
Everything happens for a reason.
Everything happens for a reason.
At last, he came.
The book is small.
I'm going to tell Tom the truth.
I want to climb Mt. Fuji again.
Her uncle is a famous doctor.
And now, it's my turn!
She presented me to her brother.
His father was a policeman.
Where is Hakata station located?
Tom wants attention.
He's working at his English.
She lived there about five years.
I'll go buy some bread.
I'll go buy some bread.
When he had no money, he couldn't buy any bread.
I've been looking for a girl like you.
Do you know which book she wants to read?
I resemble my mother.
I'm still eating.
Why are you leaving?
He will arrive there about five o'clock.
There's not enough coffee.
Tell me what happened to him.
We will see whether he will recognize me or not.
She will become a doctor.
Enter or exit.
I thought you might know where Tom went.
Don't you feel cold?
I'm going to Paris in the fall.
Shall we go to my place or yours?
She has five older brothers.
We must sit down.
Who are these guys?
It is impossible for me to do the work in a week.
What a strange dog!
Will you go, too?
I don't want to do his work for him.
Any child can do that.
My dad is stronger than your dad.
Where did you get that?
How did that happen?
You have no idea how important you are to me.
I heard everything.
That's beyond my strength.
He goes to school by bus.
Never mind what she says.
He's not a hero.
I didn't hear you come in.
Are things OK with you?
It's not my problem.
I talked to him on the phone.
I want to hear it again.
We had a test.
I can understand why you don't want to eat there.
Which book is better?
I've waited for it.
You may give the book to whoever wants it.
English is spoken in many parts of the world.
You have to work, not think.
He looked like a doctor.
He wants a book to read.
Stephen King is one of my favourite writers.
The book is on the desk.
We're here.
Will you type this, please?
That isn't exactly what I said.
Forget him.
Sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do.
All roads lead to Elsinore.
I was happy for him.
I don't know when he'll come here.
I'm just going to stay home.
Yesterday I simply did not go to work.
I don't know what to do tonight!
Let's not do that.
She was out of Japan last year.
Give them to me.
Explain it in plain words.
France is adjacent to Spain.
Traffic is a major urban problem.
He is a famous physicist not only in Japan, but in the world.
I was happy to help you.
His hands were deep in his pockets.
You must inform your superior of the results.
She usually wears jeans.
I thought you were right.
Where are we going next?
Did you forget something?
I asked what he was going to do.
He doesn't know if that tree is real.
They don't know what they should do with the money.
That tree grows next to her house.
He can't remember where he lives at all.
I don't like my hair at all.
He doesn't see the point in life.
Do you think I don't know that?
Everyone in the town knows about it.
I remember the day you were born very well.
Don't come again.
What did you do at that moment?
Please show it to me again.
If you're not with us, you're against us.
Sit up straight.
Does he have many books?
I lived in this house as a child.
I don't need a history lesson.
The more we have, the more we want.
He didn't reply to my letter.
She reads the newspaper every morning.
I think he did it.
I would rather not go.
I go every year.
You nearly died.
It seems that I have known you all my life.
He got to London yesterday.
That's my dog Fido. I love him.
He must find work.
You must find work.
My sister lives near Yokohama.
I wish I could live near your house.
I like languages!
What! You didn't really do that?
He showed it to me.
We wrote many books about China.
Is your mother at home?
Can you give that chair to her?
You'd better go.
There are things in this world which simply cannot be expressed in the form of words.
You didn't hear this from me.
It has nothing to do with me.
I can't understand what you said at all.
It's finally Friday.
He worked all day yesterday.
I see a boy.
He shall not come here again.
Tom understood.
You'd better not go out.
We're ready to leave.
Cold as it was, we went out.
Even an intelligent child cannot understand.
Really? Why?
He gave it a new name.
Your watch is similar to mine in shape and color.
She looks like her mother, I tell you.
I won't let him come here again.
It is a long way to the village.
Please tell me where to go next.
Please tell me where to go next.
One who has no goals in life, lives only to die.
I've got the tingles again.
Why are you doing this?
Who do you mean?
My mother didn't see the boy on the street.
I cannot give you a definite answer today.
The cherry trees are in full blossom.
It may rain tonight.
I'll try harder next time.
I would like to purchase some boots.
This room has three windows.
Has your father arrived yet?
I don't want to talk about it right now.
I can hardly believe his story.
She moved back with her parents.
It's mine, not his.
It's his, isn't it?
Could this be love?
Thousands of people were there.
He's so kind!
There's been a lot of rain this year.
That's actually not true.
You were at home yesterday, weren't you?
We're going to travel to Estonia next month.
He has never been to Okinawa before.
He has never been to Okinawa before.
My parents don't want me drinking beer every night.
Tom was cold.
She told everybody at work.
He told everybody at school.
I don't know what to do about him.
I don't know what to do about her.
There's no cure for death.
How are we going to do that?
I must be out of my mind.
It's the first thing that my father wrote.
It seems like just yesterday that you were here.
He still remembers you.
You can pick up a lot of words by reading.
That's exactly what he wanted.
He asked for a lot of money.
She is working on the problem.
A room for two with bath, please.
What if she doesn't like me?
Is the bath clean?
It will not be long before we know the result.
How many books have you got?
Please remember to write to her.
The girls are reading their book.
It wasn't true.
He must go there tomorrow.
My father died when I was seven years old.
He told him about his cats.
I can't recall her name at the moment.
Do you speak my language?
He did not go out, he sat down.
One day I found a box there.
By the way, where do you live?
We are afraid of death.
No, this is my son's DVD.
What do you like to do in your free time?
What you are saying does not make sense.
Don't you remember my name?
I have so much work that I will stay for one more hour.
Do you accept Visa?
All aboard!
Tell me what happened.
She became a woman.
I have been to Rome.
You can't attend? Why not?
Was there a book on the desk?
That is your major problem.
My uncle died a year ago.
How are your parents doing?
Those who do not wish to go need not go.
Why are you asking me all these questions?
He lived next to his uncle.
Must you go to the post office?
I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry.
I was kicked in the back.
The admission is ten dollars a person.
Were you at school at that time?
The girl I told you about lives in Kyoto.
She shouldn't go by herself.
Men believe what they want to.
Maybe he has lots of girlfriends.
Your parents didn't come, did they?
Had I known the truth, I would have told it to you.
I'd like to live in New York.
I learned it from him.
We need an ambulance.
I proposed that she come with me.
What a lot of books he has!
Come again tomorrow.
All the people on earth are brothers.
God is good.
He's strong enough to lift that.
He has written many books about China.
Will she come?
What do I owe you?
What do I owe you?
I killed a god.
They consider him a hero.
Who painted these pictures?
Please call me Joe.
This is Ali's book.
The Kiso River is often called the Rhine of Japan.
It's easy to answer your question.
Now, let's begin our job.
She passed right by me without noticing.
He went by me without noticing me.
This is the book which you are looking for.
I share the room with my sister.
The sisters are quite alike.
I think it can be no other reason but that.
When did you notice that?
I'm very thirsty.
Many trees are cut down in the world.
I'm taking my book with me.
I have to take my medicine every six hours.
Look on me, and do likewise.
I love soul food.
He had no money with him then.
She came last.
I stayed indoors because it rained.
This girl is from Japan.
We're going to travel to Estonia at the end of next month.
The question is where to buy the book.
Do whatever he tells you.
Why don't you stick around for a few minutes?
Why don't you start?
Why don't you start?
Why don't you slow down a little bit?
We'll come back tomorrow.
He waited his turn.
I simply wanted to see what was going on.
So everyone understands: This is my country, and her problems are my problems
I would like you to be here.
It's difficult to answer this question.
So where did you live?
We will stay here until Sunday.
We will stay here until Sunday.
He managed to climb the mountain.
That's my concern.
She read the book all night.
She screamed for help.
No body.
I have never been to Europe.
I have never been to Europe.
She called for help.
Everything appears to be going well.
I can put things in a box.
Not at all.
Where did you stay?
When asked how to do it, he said he didn't know.
We have a cat and a dog.
I tried not to look into her eyes.
It was cold yesterday, but it is still colder today.
I was in the right place at the right time.
You haven't answered my question.
His hair was long last year.
What're they doing?
What time do you leave work?
The power is out.
She was about to go out.
When did you come to Paris?
He has his own car.
There wasn't a soul in sight.
He put his room in order.
I will never forget you.
Wait in line, please.
My ex-husband no longer lives in this city.
What do you want to do tomorrow?
What do you want to learn?
She's old, ugly and fat.
Who are all these people?
She sat gazing out of the window.
He knows he did something wrong.
Stay with us.
Stay with us.
You must take the medicine!
That's okay.
Is the cat on the chair or under the chair?
I'm looking for an old man.
There were twenty or so people there.
It's the shortest route to Paris.
I have a book in my hand.
Do you plan to go to Tokyo by bus?
The streets in Hokkaido are wide.
You have broad shoulders.
As soon as the game started, it began to rain.
Please help me with this.
In this company, there are more women than men.
She does it faster than you.
They had no money left.
I bought three bottles of wine.
Tom died some years ago.
Oh, I know this man!
Animals cannot exist without air and water.
I hear voices in my head.
The image of my mother is on my mind.
You can stay at my place.
I don't know if she will go there with me.
My room is number five.
I watched the game from beginning to end.
I looked around me.
After that, he went home.
The couple was walking arm in arm.
Give me a sheet of paper.
The buses run every ten minutes.
I am tired of hearing that.
I must be going.
If you are strong, I am strong.
If you are strong, I am strong.
If you are strong, I am strong.
I'll be back at seven o'clock.
You live in Tokyo, don't you?
I must go there.
Yesterday, he told me the truth.
Yesterday, he told me the truth.
Stay right where you are.
I eat because I'm hungry.
I eat because I'm hungry.
I am ready to follow you.
I like to be alone.
I found him sleeping in his house.
How long have you been standing here?
Are you ready for Y2K?
I don't think he will come.
I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.
He has short hair.
I wrote five letters before I went to bed.
He agreed with me.
I need help!
There was a great deal of snow last year.
I hear with my ears.
You should do that right away.
I'd like to see what you have in your hand.
He taught us that Columbus discovered America.
It turned out that she was ill.
Do you know where your father went?
Tom says he has something to show us.
He is afraid that he will die.
He's armed to the teeth.
I don't know her name.
I don't know his name.
She hasn't come yet.
They are gray.
My father's room is very big.
Her attention is focused on children.
Have you already forgotten me?
Come back tomorrow.
Don't say bad things about others.
Don't say bad things about others.
We're working together.
I feel that something is wrong.
Have you found any good solution?
I will show you how to go to the park.
Can Tom help us?
I never knew his first name.
There's so much left for me to learn.
I tried but failed to stop him.
I thought you might know where Tom went.
I miss you, it's been a week since I last saw you.
Happiness is sometimes hard to find.
Russia is the biggest state in the world, and The Vatican is the smallest state in the world.
Tom shouldn't have told me.
It's getting hotter and hotter.
I'd like to sleep with you.
The question is whether he can do it or not.
Your record in mathematics is good.
I'm not going to play this game.
I wrote a letter to my mother.
To tell the truth, I've forgotten his name.
There were not many women doctors in those days.
I think I understand.
We wish to remain what we are.
Real men drink tea.
I'll never forget the sight.
I'm having the same problems.
I plan to stay in the city.
He can hardly speak.
He can hardly speak.
I don't think they heard us.
Stay out of my way!
There's so much I want to tell you.
Which of those girls do you like?
All the people were moved by his speech.
We'll see.
We'll never forget your kindness.
I've loved you from the moment I saw you.
Tom writes slowly.
Don't talk to anyone.
I just found a solution for the problem.
Who is that old man?
I'm very glad I wasn't there.
Charlotte, what's this language?
I received a good job offer.
Each of his children has his own room.
You can't believe everything you hear.
I had nothing to do with that.
You should not talk back like that.
How do they do that?
Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone.
How many people work here?
My room is twice as big as his.
My mother is writing a letter now.
You shouldn't say it.
She did what she had to do.
Have they arrived yet?
Let her sleep.
A dog runs faster than a human.
Tom understood immediately.
Tom waited calmly.
Please be so kind as to show me the way to the station.
I heard someone scream.
I'd like you to see it.
He'll do whatever you ask him to.
They can't all be bad.
I'm not sure when he'll come back.
Tom was up all night studying.
It's almost time to get started.
Take mine.
Which house are you staying in?
He stayed in the hotel.
Work began almost immediately.
He stayed here for a while.
I stay at home on Sundays.
His mother was right.
I'm ready to die.
The soup I had was so hot I couldn't drink it.
His speech impressed us very much.
You have to do what you think is right.
You saved my life.
What is going on there now?
How much did they give you for your old car?
He raised his hand.
Ask your dad to help you.
Shall we take a taxi?
What's that got to do with Tom?
Who did you kill?
This can't be!
No way!
Next time, I'll do it myself.
I opened the box — it was empty.
Please don't tell anyone about this.
His plan was discarded.
Go see a doctor.
I am determined to be a scientist.
I wanted to go to Paris.
I'm an only child.
We saw them leave.
What shall I do with her letter?
I don't know what to do tomorrow.
She's not coming back.
He is young at heart.
I won't do that again.
We don't need you.
Tom didn't know this.
My husband comes home at about eight.
No one agreed with me.
He's agreed to do the job.
Should I leave?
These books are yours.
Take as many as you want.
He is quite tall.
How much housework did you do?
Do you like these songs?
Is that clock going?
I was on the wrong bus.
There are some things money can't buy.
May I do it right now?
What can be done?
Will you make coffee for me?
She has a photographic memory.
No, it cannot be true.
We were not afraid.
We'll give you anything you want.
He did not say a word.
Start reading where you left off.
I thought you were injured.
I live in the country.
This is how I solved the problem.
Do you think I don't know what's going on?
What do you plan on doing tonight?
If he doesn't come, what'll you do?
If he doesn't come, what will you do then?
Get out of the classroom.
It's this book.
I didn't hear you come in.
Nobody knows his name.
This is the hotel where we stayed that time.
Will he die?
You aren't fat.
In some sense, you are right.
In a sense, you are right.
Where exactly did you go?
He knows what's going on.
Think before you act.
Think before you act!
Come any time after nine.
Could you advance me some money?
Don't act like a child.
He forgot it again.
He shows warm affection for his children.
He's not afraid of anyone.
How long has it been since that happened?
How much is the admission?
How much will you allow me for this?
I couldn't do this all alone.
I know her, but I'm not acquainted with the rest of the family.
I was here two months ago.
I'll be there before eight, if at all.
Is everyone against him?
She is an old acquaintance of mine.
There's very little activity around here on Sundays.
Wait until after I come back.
We have agreed on everything.
What do you aim to be?
What is your aim in life?
Who is acting as head?
It is impossible for me to solve the problem.
He wanted to know more about the trees, too.
Control yourself!
The boy doesn't see the letter.
When will they arrive?
Better dead than red.
You have to clean your room.
I wanted to go there.
Do you know how to play mahjong?
Please don't leave.
That's a horse of a different colour.
I had to make a decision.
You say that because you don't know what's going on.
I thought you'd left.
Nothing's keeping me here anymore.
The tongue ever turns to the aching tooth.
This is not the end of the world.
Any child knows that.
Work quickly, eat slowly.
The cat is playing with the children.
She gave him a lot of money.
I want a person who can speak French.
I found this under your bed.
We can't do this.
Don't be scared.
Everything I said was true.
I don't go to school on Sunday.
She's crazy about him.
Can you help me?
I want you to know that I believe you.
We're not afraid of death.
We aren't afraid of death.
Do you know how to play mahjong?
I'll go first!
I wrote three letters last night.
What Chinese restaurant do you go to?
Let them all come.
We only want to help you.
We only want to help you.
That doesn't make any sense.
He will be able to do the work soon.
Tom doesn't like either beer or wine.
That's enough for now.
She knows how to cook.
He's in a bad state.
God does not exist.
God does not exist.
You should take a day off.
I left something in the room.
He teaches us English.
What was he doing when you saw him?
It is my father's house.
Noboby seems to care about my problem.
They slept in the same room.
It has not rained this month yet.
Work fast, eat slow.
Tom couldn't find what he was looking for.
Tom couldn't find what he was looking for.
My parents won't mind.
Sweden has a language of its own.
I'm not able to respond to all of your questions.
There is little time left.
We didn't think of that.
Why don't we sit down?
Why don't we go inside?
The strangest thing is that I don't recognize anyone.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
You've gone mad.
I am waiting for my friend.
I tried to cheer him up.
Money is not everything.
I had a toothache yesterday.
I live in this house by myself.
Remember this!
I have to know if it is true.
Show me how to do this.
The sky is as blue as blue can be.
I thought you'd understand.
She shot a glance at her mother.
My fate is in your hands.
He has no definite object in life.
I've been waiting for this moment.
He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.
He's not a doctor.
The world is full of incompetent doctors.
We stayed in a chalet.
I saw it happen in five minutes!
I'm going to report you to police.
I didn't need anyone's help.
I think Tom needs your help.
Feel this.
We can do this.
Our country stands at the end of the beginning.
I'm going to find you wherever you are and kill you.
He understands her problems more or less.
Where's your medication?
I miss that place.
He's not my boyfriend.
Don't you want to know who I was with?
There are some things that money can't buy.
Let us know whether you can come.
What can you give me?
What can you give me?
I thought it'd be worth it.
I plead guilty.
What do you want this for?
She gave him a book.
Her answer couldn't be understood.
We do have other choices.
Don't go home yet.
He wasn't even there.
She doesn't have any brothers or sisters.
This bed is heavy.
One stayed and the other went away.
She is still a girl.
Where's the source of this river?
My brother looks a lot like me.
She is going to France next week.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be right with you.
He is at work now, but will be coming home at seven.
They cannot stop him.
It doesn't exist.
It doesn't exist.
What should I name it?
Tom is ill.
We'll find out soon.
They all stood.
I'm not your love.
Tom, don't leave.
Wait. Don't go.
This should be clear to everyone.
Tom helped because he wanted to.
I can't tell you why she was absent from school.
He's skinny.
Let me know.
Let me know.
Take this.
He didn't say a word to me all day.
Do you really want to do that?
Were you at home last night?
He shouted, "Get out!"
Do you speak Russian?
He may have been right.
Tom didn't want that.
I'm on friendly terms with her.
Make a decision.
Make a decision.
Are you in trouble with the law?
Are you in trouble with the law?
That's totally normal.
Don't ever talk to me like that again.
What do you do in Japan?
I'm so fat.
I'm going to do it.
What are you doing in Brazil?
I know all about you.
This time, you've gone too far.
She has no fear.
He will not come today.
It is our turn to laugh.
I don't believe you!
They went to Chicago by car.
Do you smell something?
He fed his dog at the same time every day.
I'm not in the least afraid of it.
But what will you do if he doesn't come?
Actions, not words.
She is no longer what she was five years ago.
I didn't know he was dead.
I was leaving home, when it started to rain.
Don't try to do too much.
Did you actually see it?
Yes, it has already started.
I want you to know what really happened.
Don't ask me anything.
Give me your phone.
This is a boy.
Almost no one believed her.
He killed me with one word.
Can you come?
Can you come?
You will be laughed at.
It's easier to play than to work.
If you can't come, send someone in your stead.
I have my reasons.
I think Tom needs your help.
I received a letter from my brother.
I received a letter from my brother.
There is not one of us who does not want to help you.
We will do our best.
This is the room where the body was found.
Tell me what really happened.
I just want to be your friend.
Thanks a lot! I don't know what we'd do without you.
I saw a dog.
What would they do without us?
They know what happened.
They know what happened.
You're not fat.
Stay in the car.
Should I reply to his letter?
Should I reply to his letter?
What were you eating?
She is crazy about me.
If my brother were here, he would know what to do.
He still has not written the letter.
Did they say what happened?
It's yours.
It's yours.
This is yours.
It's yours.
I worked a lot this week.
I bought the book which the children need.
I see life differently now.
Your place or mine?
Nobody knows how I feel.
He had no money.
What did you do then?
I didn't understand you.
He has just become a principal.
I think he'll come.
Tom speaks five languages, including Russian.
Answer me!
She starts her job at seven o'clock.
He explained the matter to me.
He explained the matter to me.
I don't quite understand what you are saying.
From whom did you learn that?
When did it begin to rain?
Lie still.
Can we say "No" to America?
Bring your sister next time.
We will have guests tomorrow.
She means more than my life to me.
I listened.
He is a type of a person who calls a spade a spade.
Tom glanced at the clock.
She does what she wants.
Can you show me the way?
That's not the only problem.
I don't like you at all.
Wait here till he comes back.
Because they are clean.
I don't understand a word of what he's saying.
If you understand, then do it properly.
I don't know how you did it.
Tom can't leave.
Tom answered my question.
Do you feel bad?
It is difficult to be nobody.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I already said no.
I'll never forget what you've done for me.
There are many books in my room.
I don't know what to do with this.
There's no point in living any longer.
There is no returning on the road of life.
And what should we do?
I understand the problem.
We plan to stay a week.
I know what the problem is.
Don't you get it? This isn't about you.
He was running and calling for help.
A good idea came to him.
Nobody will notice.
Do as I tell you.
I didn't think you would come.
I didn't hear you come in.
I didn't hear you come in.
What's she doing?
Nobody was home.
She had no money.
I can't trust you.
I can't trust you.
I can't trust you.
They need money.
Do you know who wrote this book?
He is a head taller than me.
I sent you a letter.
Thank you all so much.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Are your parents still living?
He doesn't have any real friends.
Don't make fun of me!
Let me look.
She was afraid of the dog.
Tom walks slowly.
Are you afraid of death?
There's something under the bed.
It was a cold night.
There is a bottle of wine on the table.
No one believed me.
I'm not your enemy.
Is she a pretty girl?
Don't eat this.
He's all yours.
He loses his temper easily.
This is exactly what I wanted to see!
Do you really want to stay?
Do you really want to wait a year?
Come closer.
I know the reason, but I can't tell you.
This is how I made it.
It happened that we were on the same bus.
Tofu goes well with sake.
She can't write or read.
I can't be seen with you.
I can't be killed so easily.
I know what you mean.
I'm coming to your rescue!
The next day, Isabela came back home.
I don't know what's happened.
He left the book on the table.
Do people eat well in this restaurant?
I can't do two things at once.
Tom couldn't do this alone.
Tom knows everybody.
Don't believe him!
Don't believe him!
All I can say is that I'd rather not go.
I wouldn't like to live there.
Nobody heard Tom's screams.
These are my friends.
Next time I'll come earlier.
He told me that she was sick.
We don't need her.
It is only you who want it.
How much time are you going to stay in France?
I was absent from school because I was sick.
This is a tree.
Love doesn't exist.
They believe in God.
How did Tom manage to do that?
They weren't afraid.
She's a real friend.
Don't ever do it again.
Have I done something wrong?
He lives all by himself in the country.
I heard about your problems.
The man was on the brink of death.
Who are those men?
Take no prisoners.
When did you arrive?
When did you arrive?
I want you to tell me everything you know about that.
I want you to tell me everything you know about that.
You made a good decision.
You're the first person I told that to.
Really? "Yes, really."
Let's get together here once a week.
Where's your father now?
I didn't quite catch your words.
I can't tell you the truth.
I can't tell you the truth.
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
She asked him to stay, but he had to go to work.
No one understands what's going on.
You're probably too young to understand what's happening.
What does your father work as?
I want to see that.
Either he is wrong or I am.
Your face is red.
Your face is dirty.
I don't want to see your face again.
I know your face.
I want to see your real face.
The woman is ready.
I went to sleep about 10 o'clock.
I read a lot of books in English.
This one is as good as that one.
We're ready for this.
I have to be back home by seven.
I will explain it to him.
I will explain it to her.
I will do all I can for you.
Take the money and run.
Please smile.
I wasn't even there.
What could that mean?
Let's see what you're made of.
What could be the meaning of it?
The book is on the table.
Everyone except me knew it.
Do you need a car?
The prisoner was released.
I gave my word.
Which of your parents do you think you look like?
He might have been sleeping at that time.
Everyone agreed.
Does she have children?
I'm crazy for you!
I owe you five dollars.
A tall man came up to me.
A wise man would not say such a thing.
What does Tom intend to do about it?
That's my boy.
We need help.
Nobody knows this.
Why don't you answer me?
She won't make it.
The girls were sitting side by side.
We need action, not words.
Can you call me a taxi?
Don't come.
Children are playing behind the house.
You again?
If you don't go, I won't, either.
The reason I'm here is because I was asked to come.
He has two boys and a girl.
He was sitting next to me.
Take your shoes off.
I don't want to be your friend.
There's a letter for you.
A few days later, he came.
I'm as strong as you.
Can you show me?
I'd like to go with you.
Everyone always asks me that.
It isn't the same thing.
Stay out of the rain.
I'd like you to answer my question.
How heavy you are!
Who needs them?
He stayed alone.
I can't keep living the way I've been living.
He has done much for his company.
Does he have anything to do with the political party?
It does not matter to me whether you come or not.
Where would you like to live?
What makes us human?
Don't depend on it.
Tom wanted me to be something I wasn't.
We weren't cold.
We were cold.
I felt cold.
Watch the forest!
I was almost right.
I never work on weekends.
All of a sudden, he proposed to me.
A couple of new guests entered the room.
You'll get into trouble if your parents find out.
I want to be here with you.
We offered him a good job.
She looked at me.
How strong he is!
Her real name is Lisa.
How old are your kids?
I think about her often.
I think about them often.
How did you do this?
Don't be crazy!
Are these yours?
Are you sure you're not tired?
I can't buy a book this expensive.
I had a long talk with her.
Would you mind if I kissed you?
I have noticed this too.
I don't like it, but I will do it anyway.
He forgot his name.
He forgot his name.
I like my new job.
You forgot his name.
Tom has to go home now.
He is always on the move.
You're welcome!
He wished he had more time.
I don't think we should stay here.
All of us were silent.
We are speaking about the same thing, just in different words.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
Out of my way, boy.
Yes. That's right.
How beautiful you are!
You are not the only one who is dead.
These books aren't just for children.
In that case, you are right.
My brother has no money.
I would like to go, too.
These are very old books.
Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains.
I can't describe how I felt.
I don't like this city at all.
Almost all dogs are alive.
Do you have any plans for today?
You're either with me or you're against me.
Have you forgotten?
Bring that here.
He's crazy about her.
What exactly did you say?
I've never told anyone this before.
I'm trying to work out this problem.
Does she want to look at it?
I've seen a lot of him recently.
Take what you want.
Are these your things?
Where did you get all that money from?
You've got it wrong.
It's even worse than it looks.
Sick as he was, he went to school.
What does this even mean?
Will he come home soon? "I'm afraid not."
She asked him if he knew where I lived.
Tell me about your wife.
We found out that he was her father.
Tell me about your wife.
Kate was lying with her eyes open.
No matter what happens, I am prepared.
She may have been right.
At last he appeared.
You can do better than this.
Tom doesn't want to talk to anybody.
It's Ying Li.
All's fair in love and war.
Are you trying to kill me?
Follow his example.
You will see.
You will see.
You will see.
You will see.
I saw what you did.
I saw what you did.
I saw what you did.
I saw what you did.
I saw what you did.
I saw what you did.
When did you visit New York?
The whole country is talking about it.
These headphones don't work.
Tom doesn't know where to go.
Tom doesn't know where he should go.
When did you come?
When did you come?
I do not trust him any longer.
He's over forty.
Who else can answer my question?
Is your mom home?
I'll have the same.
I'll have what he's having.
They can understand me.
Place the boxes one above the other, please.
No one agreed with him.
You'll be in my heart today and always.
I'll take this one.
It's a very bizarre animal.
He shall die.
She introduced her sister to him.
There were enough seats for all of us.
This room is too small for us.
I don't know when I will return.
I'm kind of happy for you.
What did you do over the weekend?
It's my turn to drive next.
They say she's sick.
They say she's sick.
I didn't know that.
If you want to hear a scary story, I'll tell you about a dream I had a few weeks ago.
I would like to help you.
So, what happened this time?
Today, I have other plans.
We must inform them.
I knew you would come.
I know you wanted to show me something.
I know you wanted to show me something.
Where did you put them?
Where did you drop them?
My father will kill me.
Where's everyone going?
There's something I want to ask you.
Do you really think that?
Does he know what you did?
Don't you think it's strange that he's not here?
I am yours and you are mine.
I am yours and you are mine.
I am yours and you are mine.
I am yours and you are mine.
He came several times.
Do you want to leave it like that?
Are you a doctor?
I believe Tom is right.
She is so tall!
I like that job.
I like this job.
I didn't need your help.
My uncle lives in New York.
Excuse me, but may I open the window?
Tom knows who killed his dog.
I took my shoes off and put them under the bed.
Are you an only child?
Are you close to your family?
Are you for or against my plan?
Are you free tonight?
Where is our companion?
My son shall do the work.
Why didn't you just leave?
I asked him to help me.
Show me everything.
You're not sick.
You're not sick.
You're not sick.
I wish I had a friend like you.
This car is black.
Don't follow me.
You still haven't told me why you're here.
I no longer believe it.
Do you plan to work until 10:00?
Are you sane?
Come what may, I am prepared for it.
By the way, are you free tonight?
I don't believe him at all.
Give me the book.
She did not answer all the questions.
This is the beginning of the end!
I really do have to go.
Are you studying English?
Are you writing a letter?
During the rush hours in Tokyo, traffic is heavy.
I don't know if it's what he wants or not.
Why does everything happen to me?
You're the oldest.
That's really not the same thing.
He had no money and so could not buy any food.
What did you do with those books?
What did you do with those books?
Bring them to me.
I don't have a single enemy.
I don't have enemies.
It seems to me that the pictures speak for themselves.
I wish you had told me the truth.
Everyone's been talking about it.
Tom wants me to stay for a couple of weeks.
She decided not to go.
The car he's driving is not his.
Oh, please don't say that.
Tell it to somebody else.
Think about this.
I don't like living in the country.
I have a book.
Maybe she likes you, too.
He was afraid of his wife.
She came.
She must go there.
They're not ready.
Are you an only child?
She'll be back soon.
She's an heroin addict.
Do you have enough money?
We finally did it.
We finally did it.
Yes, we want that.
Put the book on the table.
He took a book from the bookshelf.
You can't do it alone. Ask someone to help you.
His son has what it takes to be a good doctor.
Nobody's killed me yet.
We've had several meetings.
I had a cat.
Just tell me what happened.
As you say, Russian is very hard!
They know the truth.
They are right.
I thought you'd agree.
I thought you'd agree.
Ask me anything!
He came by bus.
It's started raining.
I'm sometimes in a bad temper.
Are you free this weekend?
Are you free this weekend?
I still believe in love.
We're counting on your help.
Come and visit me when you are feeling better.
I only want what's best for you.
He was familiar with the roads of Tokyo.
Two blacks do not make a white.
There are many people trying to buy houses.
Do you have a plan?
I don't want Tom to leave.
I got caught in a storm on my way home.
The wind blew all day.
She's an only child.
I know everybody here.
I need you here.
It wasn't always like that.
She has breast cancer.
Today was very hot.
We considered that.
When she opened her eyes I was the first person she saw.
I thought I was going crazy.
We've already met.
I found out where she is.
Stop me if you can.
Show them to me.
I called a doctor.
At last, it began to rain.
It's all your fault.
I usually take a shower in the evening.
I love my work.
Her heart is sick.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
I don't believe that's the truth.
Why didn't you call the police?
Why didn't you call the police?
I will never forget you.
He still hasn't responded to my letter.
I asked her if she had been to Mexico.
Why don't you want to tell us the truth?
He has no wife, no children and no friends.
Yes, I think you should go.
That restaurant's too expensive.
Can you tell me what's going on?
Do you really want to have kids?
Do you really want to have kids?
I don't want to be your enemy.
I've had to do everything by myself.
Years passed.
Do you really want someone else to do it?
It came to nothing.
Are you laughing at me?
Are you laughing at me?
He came after you left.
Come quickly!
Let me think a minute.
Let me think for a while.
You will do it whether you like it or not.
You will do it whether you like it or not.
Where have they gone?
Where have they gone?
Mari has been to Hungary.
She got up at seven in the morning.
Don't get off the bus till it stops.
It is difficult to live easy.
That's where we'll go.
You're avoiding me, aren't you?
I've waited too long for this.
I've waited too long for this.
This word comes from Greek.
I forgot to ask him.
You don't have to go.
Come here!
Did he forget the money?
We'll do it tomorrow.
It was a dark night.
I've been up all night studying.
I don't need you.
You've really helped me a lot.
You've really helped me a lot.
Have you written a book?
Have you written a book?
I know it's not your fault.
I know it's none of my business.
I know it was Tom.
I know it's hard for you to understand.
Your car is cheaper than mine.
Don't depend on your parents too much.
I sat beside her.
I didn't understand what you said.
I'd like to reserve a single room.
I have her in my pocket.
Nobody works in my country.
Tom seems to know the way.
This book was new.
I'm responsible.
He gave me some money.
I want to believe that everything's all right.
Japan is an island country.

You are my friends
Tom arrived by car.
I've been waiting for you for a whole hour.
How old were you when you had your first girlfriend?
I am going to go to Tokyo tomorrow.
Who's laughing now?
They had seven children.
She was not feeling well.
The day that he was born was rainy.
I don't believe in miracles.
I'm asking for your help.
I'm asking for your help.
I'm going to be a father.
I'm going to be an uncle.

I'm going to your house.
Was it good?

How did it go?
Now you do it.

Tom felt fine.
Tom got the job.
We had a plan.
Can this be it?
Can we do this?
Come on, do it.
Did we have it?
Do it now, Tom.
Give us a hand.
Is it a weapon?
It was my plan.

How do we do it?
There's something wrong here, but I just can't put my finger on it.
Is this a different word or just another form of the same word?
It's the first house after you turn the corner.
I finally was able to find out where Tom lives.
I couldn't figure out what Tom was going to do.
Can't you find someone else to do this for you?
Follow this road till you come to the river.
By this time, the whole house was in flames.
Do you remember the first time I came here?
I think there's somebody following us.
This took place on the following day.
Put the book back where you found it.
How much do you want for this book?
You'd better send for the doctor.
Is it hard for you to do this?
Tom is the third man in line.
Is that law still in force?
Can you find your way home?
Are you for or against it?
May I have the floor?
I was afraid of my father.
I was afraid of my father.
I was afraid of my father.
I was afraid of my father.
Tom immediately recognized me.
That's enough for today!
It's no use waiting for him to come.
There is no sense in standing when there are seats available.
I don't want to know what you think about this.
I don't want to know what you think about this.
I'd forgotten about that.

You'd better ask Dr. Tanaka.
No, I saw it. It's true!

Emily is writing a letter.
I knew that was going to happen.
There was blood all over the floor.
You didn't know that either.
My father quit drinking.
I can't understand.
It's a good one.
It's a good one.
This was a good book.
This time you won't be alone.
This time you won't be alone.
This time you won't be alone.
I have a heart.
He came to my house.
He asked for help.
I often have the same dream.
He called me Ichiro.
He came about four o'clock.
He came by bus.
He came here again.
He came home at ten.
He came in just as I was going out.
Your blood is red.
You should write a letter.
You should write a letter.
You should write a letter.
What must I do?
What should I do?
I eat a book.
I understand your words.
I can't leave you here alone.
I want to go to heaven, but I don't want to die to get there!
The boy looks like his father.
If you've forgotten everything, then why do I remember everything?
We don't know whether to believe Tom or not.
Who's paying for the food?
I am trying.
She went upstairs to her room.
I've been trying to understand how that's possible.
I wanted to work this summer.
That's why I came here.
He asked me if I was happy.
I don't know what love is.
He came to Japan when he was 10 years old.
He can read and write.
He can read pretty well.
He speaks ten languages.
I know who my enemy is.
I just want you to know I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I caught a cold.
She agreed with him.
What would you do if you were in my position?
I'll only be staying a few days.
Don't pay attention to him.
He can't do it.
How much do I need to pay?
You really want to do this, don't you?
Don't say his name.
I was at the supermarket.
I went to the supermarket.
He needs to forget about that woman and his children.
He read this book yesterday.
I will come.
I can't go without seeing him.
Which school is the best?
Which school is the best?
He taught me history.
Take that off your head.
My mother is a sister of their mother.
I do all the work.
Tom almost never asks about that.
We need your help!
We need your help!
It's almost seven. We have to go to school.
He comes from the middle class.
He comes round once a week.
Would you like to tell me something else?
Whatever she says is true.
I would do it again.
I would do it again.
I would do it again.
She's not my girlfriend.
She has died.
Tom doesn't understand what's happening.
Push!
Eat your soup, John!
Do you talk to your cats?
I know that wasn't Tom.
Mother decided otherwise.
Everybody here seems to know you.
What will I forget to write?
We'd like a double room with bath.
We'd like a double room with bath.
In this group, there are my parents and my relatives.
No one listens to me.
Eat a lot of vegetables.
I don't have any free time today.
That chair goes in the corner.
We always go home together.
Let him go hungry.
You've already forgotten.
You've already forgotten.
I should go with you.
I should go with you.
She is connected with that company.
We can't help you with that.
We can't help you with that.
I will go to the school tomorrow.
There were three men.
Have you got plans?
Have you got plans?
I see your house.
I won't leave you alone with Tom.
I won't leave you alone with Tom.
Tom began a new life.
You have to do it again.

You can spend the night with us.

As I was ill, I couldn't go to the meeting.
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
She wants me to go with her.

Where are your eyes?
Does your friend like tea?
Does your friend like tea?
May it be so!
I read your book.
I read your book.
I read your book.
I read your book.
I read your book.

Tom came yesterday.
She showed him my picture.
I took the book.
I'm as strong as before.
I'm as strong as before.
I took the book.
That's OK with me.
That's not what I mean.
I have become disgusted of living.
You're the enemy.
Get up for a moment.
She died five years ago.
He died five years ago.
My watch has stopped.
This book is very heavy.
I have other plans.
Two can play at that game.
I suppose you have the right to know.
He crossed the street.
He delivered a speech.
What happened to the book I put here yesterday?
What happened to the book I put here yesterday?
What has become of the book I put here yesterday?
Tom forgot where he put his glasses.
Have you seen this man?
Let's say you're right.
Don't think I didn't try.
Don't think I didn't try.
Don't think I didn't try.
Don't think I didn't try.
Don't think about it. Do it.
Don't think about it. Do it.
I want to think about it.
I heard something.
I heard something.

He still wants to come.
I had always wanted a son.
Her mother is writing a letter.
His mother is writing a letter.
Who told you the story?
Tom must be angry.
Why didn't you do it?
I don't understand what's going on.
I already told Tom that.
That's super easy.
How long has it been since you received a letter from him?
The boy sleeps in the living room.
I'm often here.
What are you two doing?
What are you two doing?
I went to the station.
Where are the soldiers?
She never saw her sister again.
She wrote a letter.
Emily wrote a letter.
You seemed not to know the truth.
You write better than I do.
You write better than I do.
Your book is double the size of mine.
I love my mother.
We laughed.
The woman is fat.
The woman is fat.
I went to your school.
I went to your school.
She had gone to school.
She has already gone to school.
I'm ready. And you?
I'm ready. And you?
I'm ready. And you?
She's very afraid of dogs.
He writes to his parents once a month.
Why did you return home today?
She didn't go because her boyfriend didn't.
I am the god of the new world.
Tom walked to the gate.
I am working on my new book.
I don't work for anyone.
I go to school every morning.
She became famous.
We must do something.
I give you five minutes to solve this problem.
You don't remember, do you?
You don't remember, do you?
My name is Wang.
Were I in your position, I would do it at once.
I'll never find someone like him.
They talked with her for an hour at class.
He was forced to return to Washington.
This car is very expensive.
She's not a member.
Can you please be quiet?
You shouldn't go if you don't want to.
That book is thick, but it's not very expensive.
I didn't believe them.
They entered the forest.
We don't know that yet.
We didn't know the truth.
Where will you go?
Where will you go?
Where will you go?
Where will you go?
Where will you go?
Why did I not know this?
You don't have to respond.
You don't need my help.
You must have known what she meant.
You remember him, don't you?
You were alone at that time, weren't you?
You were alone at that time, weren't you?
All Tom has to do tomorrow is go to school.
I don't believe that anymore.
You didn't forget, did you?
I love your son.
Even though I felt that there was something strange, I just didn't know what it was.
He died of lung cancer.
He doesn't eat this, does he?
He doesn't have any strength left.
He drank himself to death.
That's the only possibility.
Why don't you enter?
They weren't there.
This is only the beginning.
Come over here and sit down.
I don't want to die!
I think I want to stay.
Do you have bread for lunch?
I was on the mountain.
Is that your dog over there?
Tom took something.
Let's begin our work at once.
Do I know you?
Do I know you?
Come a little closer.
He lives far away from my house.
What do you want to watch?
I'm afraid to go.
What time do you want me to come?
We don’t mean to talk shop.
Tom always drinks coffee in the morning.
It was no problem.
Why are you following me?
Why are you following me?
Where are you going in such a hurry?
I eat and drink.
What was I thinking?
In any case, he's your big brother.
I asked him several times, but he simply didn't reply.
Yoko avoided answering my question.
The village needs your help.
I don't mind your staying here.
None of us was able to answer the question.
I plan to stay here for three days.
I plan to stay here for three days.
What did we do wrong?
In which language did the father write?
I caused you to die.
How old do I look?
I spent a year at a school in Russia.
I think we have to make a decision.
What is the story?
Thank you for all you did for me that time.
Thank you for everything you've done for Canada.
I have to run.
We got no thanks for all our work.
I want to go to Japan.
Do as he says.
There was a lot of food in the house.
There was a lot of food in the house.
Is that the same guy?
What did he ask you?
I'm just as scared as you are.
I would like to have some more tea.
I'll tell you afterwards.
But she was referring to something else.
May I open the box?
I'll be back by six.
She asked me about my mother.
I think I'll take it.
You don't have to do this.
He believes every word I say.
He felt at home.
I just want to say thanks to you all.
I want you to let me go.
I will write a letter to Judy.
Next week I'll write an e-mail to my parents.
The first step is the most difficult.
What do you really think?
You don't exert yourself much.
She was my first girlfriend.
That's exactly what he said.
That's exactly what he said.
There's the problem.
If you don't want to do it, it's OK.
If you don't want to do it, it's OK.
I was happy to help you.
I was happy to help you.
I was happy to help you.
I felt a severe pain on the shoulder.
I play Chopin.
Helen is always at the top of her class.
We found the thing we were looking for.
Just keep smiling.
I should have reported it to the police, but I didn't.
We are brother and sister.
She told me many stories about her life.
What kind of game is this?
What he says is holy truth.
I don't care what he says.
Tom hasn't come yet.
I don't have a son named Tom.
I don't have a son named Tom.
I'm writing an article.
I don't want to do this here.
I'm fine, thank you. And you?
I'll take it into consideration.
I'll tell my mom!
I'll tell my mom on you!
Tom didn't pay for it.
She shouted to him, but he didn't hear her.
Tom didn't sleep at all last night.
Should I take the bus?
He forgot her name.
Law is on my side.
Her house is near the sea.
Her husband eats everything she puts in front of him.
Her name is known all over the world.
Don't look down.
I'm awfully tired.
You may be here as long as you keep quiet.
I don't feel like working today.
Esperanto is the language of the twenty-first century.
No day without a line.
That's exactly what she wanted.
It happens more often than you would think.
It happens more often than you would think.
He tries hard.
Don't play with fire.
You should have seen it.
China is bigger than Japan.
He does everything very quickly.
You've done enough.
Did he go home yesterday?
If for some reason that should happen, what would you do?
He solved all the problems.
Tom hasn't been to the supermarket in a long time.
Don't go there now.
You have no right to do this.
He's on his way.
He asked me whether I had slept well last night.
She went off with her friends.
I've told Tom the truth.
I don't know why I did it.
The house is small, but it's enough for us.
My book is prettier than my friend's.
My sister is a very beautiful girl.
Be what you want to be.
When does he study? "He studies before dinner."
Am I your friend?
I forgot the book.
She has a beautiful voice.
It must be a very expensive restaurant!
How long have you two been together?
The book is on the shelf.
I know you can make it better.
My husband's going to kill me.
My husband's going to kill me.
We are like brothers.
He loves his own children.
He raised his hand and smiled.
You are number one!
We've barely begun.
There were the two of them - the brother and the sister.
Group the words according to meaning.
Tom guided us through the woods.
This wood has a beautiful grain.
You take too much for granted.
We lived in a great big house.
The little boy grew very fast.
The sky was gray all morning.
God knows what we'll do next.
Did you have a good time?
Give me the green book.
I was in great pain.
I guess Tom is sick.
You're not supposed to be here.
His car is similar to mine.
The two of us are finally alone.
He plays very well.
I know both of the girls.
I think Tom is very sick.
What else can we do?
My father has never been sick in his life.
Will you stay at home tonight?
Is the bath ready?
This is the strongest dog that I have ever seen.
Her legs are long.
I miss you, Tom.
He asked me for my phone number.
You may do whatever you want to do.
This was not our fault.
We will all die.
Please don't do it.
It's started already.
It's started again.
He found the box under the table.
I got something in my eye.
Tom loves his wife.
Hasn't Jim returned yet?
Tom doesn't think he'll be able come tomorrow.
I have often been there.
His house is near the subway station.
I wrote a book about China.
I wrote a book about China.
My mother wasn't a good mother.
My wife is preparing dinner right now.
His name is Kenji, but everyone calls him Ken.
What will the newspapers say?
Were you at home? "No, I wasn't."
Tom is a true hero.
I don't have enough time.
That wasn't him.
Is Tom big?
I could hardly understand him.
Life would be empty without you.
He has been sick for a week.
You were sick.
Tom was ill.
We were sick.
You were sick.
They were sick.
You weren't ill.
She wasn't sick.
Tom wasn't sick.
You're sick.
You're sick.

She is sick.
We are sick.
You are ill.
I'll make tea for you.
I am not ill.
I am not ill.
Tom's not sick.
She's not sick.
I have enough money to buy it.
I need you to come with me.
I thought you needed money.
I thought you needed money.
Anything can happen.
Is this book yours?
I wasn't even thinking about that.
I wasn't even supposed to be here.
I was told to be here on the 13th.
I was about to say the same thing.
I will be glad to come.
There are hardly any books in this room.
It's the same thing.
He's writing a book.
She's writing a book.
I write the book.
The phones aren't working.
I opened a window.
Tom seems to have it in for me.
God wills it.
I died.
They're dead.
I want your blood.
Where are you sitting now?
I only read the first three chapters.
Can you show it to me?
Can you show it to me?
Eat the bread!
Eat the bread!
Tom didn't read the book.
You were too young.
You were too young.
He's dead?
Is your headache gone?
Thanks, I understood everything.
I am after him.
Don't you understand that?
Don't you understand that?
You aren't listening to what I'm saying.
The sun was shining, yet it was cold.
He was like a father to me.
In that case, we've got a problem...
She knows what's going on.
These books are new.
Tom was tall and handsome.
He was loved by everybody.
I feel better.
I feel better now.
The streets were empty.
I don't even know where to look.
I don't even know where.
I don't even know why.
I don't even know your real name.
I don't even remember that.
I don't even think about it anymore.
I don't even think about it anymore.
I don't even want to think about it.
I don't even want to think about what could happen.
You're afraid of him.
You're afraid of him.
Who was there?
He's after me.
I needed help.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
We couldn't understand her logic.
I've never heard of her.
I've never heard of him.
Everything is under control.
Tom sat in the first row.
Tom explained how the system worked.
It turned out to be true.
Please give me the same thing.
My child likes to sleep between me and my wife.
He smiled at the girl.
He smiled at the girl.
That boy is Tony, isn't he?
I can't read lips.
Is it true that you are going to Paris?
I study for 3 hours every day.
The bus hasn't come yet.
Take this medicine every four hours.
I'll go if you will.
I'll go if you will.
It was the only way.
Did I get you right?
I'm working on that.
For instance, what would you have done if you were in my place?
Let me know the instant Tom arrives.
Tom works in a hit-or-miss fashion.
Tom held the book in his hand.
What do you want instead?
Come here, young man.
Let's go inside.
I'm not the one who did that.
I have come to kill you.
I answered the phone.
He was my best friend.
She was my best friend.
I knew there was a reason.
I knew I forgot something.
I haven't decided yet.
Look around you.
I knew they were your friends.
I knew they were your friends.
I knew this day would come.
How often do you see him?
I came back.
You wanted this, didn't you?
Come on!
I have brown hair.
Did he really say that?
How did it come out?
I want to hear your story.
Did you understand me?
You have enough time.
You're the first person I told that to.
You're the first person I told that to.
Tom talked in his sleep.
The truth is I am an animal in a human body.
He could not answer that question.
You will be famous.
He raised his hand to stop the taxi.
Why weren't they there?
Are these your children?
I know why he did it.
How well he played!
What's your father's name?
Where are your friends?
Has he gone already?
She needs you.
She needs you.
She needs you.
I'll explain it again.
I'll be there shortly.
We can't let Tom die.
We go to school every day except Sunday.
His speech was lacking in soul.
Tom recognized the old man, but didn't know his name.
The children are playing outside.
I don't know if he can come tonight.
I'm not afraid anymore.
She was sitting under a tree.
I tried to write him.
I tried to write him.
I forgot what I was going to say.
I forgot what I was going to say.
I like what I do.
We gather here once a week.
I forgot what I was going to say.
I'll be in my room.
Do you shower every day?
You go to school, don't you?

Who doesn't know it?
You've seen their new house, haven't you? What's it like?
Tom will go.
At this, he got up and went out.
I was in London last month.

I am dead to you.
I am dead to you.
He's writing a long letter.
Are we leaving?
Tom did twenty pushups.
We have the same problems as you.
Elbrus is Europe's highest mountain.
I opened the window.
Thank you very much! — You're welcome.
I don't like either tea or coffee.
That's my goal.
She talks about Paris as if she had been there many times.
I'm talking about your actions.
He did as I told him.
Tom doesn't drink alcoholic drinks at all.
Get out of my sight!
In any case, I don't like it because I don't!
I don't know all of them.
They're still alive.
They're still alive.
They're still alive.
Bring me the menu, please.
Let me introduce my parents to you.

I was playing.
You're first.
When will you arrive?
When will you arrive?
This is the very book I have been looking for.
What plans do you have for Sunday?
I go home right after work.

They haven't understood the question.
I've got nothing to do with it.
He can barely read.
Tom eats more ice cream than I do.
I can't find my watch.
When did you return?
It's time to leave for school.
My staying here is out of the question.
There's a parcel for you on the table.
Do you have some good writing paper?
Tom ought to leave before it rains.
We traveled over a very good road.
When did you come over to France?
Both my parents are still living.
The cake ought to be done soon.
Our house overlooks the river.
Let's do it ourselves.
I only work part-time.
What's left over?
It wasn't that difficult.
I'd like to go home.
They were my friends.
I wish you the same.
I've heard you've been sick.
She lives in an apartment.
Ask him when he will come back.
Ask her when he will come back.
Ask her when he will come back.
The whole town knows of it.
We have to decide today.
If you're not with us, you're against us.

A widow is a woman whose spouse has died.

She did not listen.

Just stay the way you are.
Nobody writes in Russian more than you do.
You are strong.

This is red wine.
This wine is red.
What was it like?
She has very short hair.
He has very short hair.

It's my turn.
This is the last game.
Why are you following me?
Why are you following me?
I am thinking of nothing but you.
Put it on the table.
Rasputin had the whole Russian court under his spell.

How much do you eat?
Do you speak Tagalog?
What did you find out?
What did you find out?
What station is it?
I don't like your friends at all.
I thought Tom was dead.
You should have told me a long time ago.
You should have told me a long time ago.
I felt that I should help her.
Raise your hands!
Raise your hands!
Tell me how you did it.
Tell me how you did it.
Don't be crazy!
Because it was cold yesterday, I stayed home.
I'm not sure how that happened.
I just can't understand you sometimes.

She won't leave me alone.
Not my problem.
This soup tastes really great.

I can't understand why Tom doesn't want to go with us.
I just got back in town.

Tom doesn't need glasses.
I'm trying to stop Tom.
I want you to know that I believe you.
I want to know what you're doing here.
Thanks for the call.
I looked Tom in the eyes and told him the truth.
She accompanied him to Japan.
Let's stop here.
It's about time!
I just don't know what to do.
Are you leaving?
Are you leaving?
He showed his photograph album to me.
Tom believes that there is a time and a place for everything.
We have no need for assistance.
The time has come to reinstall Windows!
The data is often inaccurate.
Do you want to know how he did it? "I'm all ears."
Do you want to know how he did it? "I'm all ears."
I know I heard something.
I love it when that happens.
I love it when that happens.
We did the sights of Yokohama.
He didn't want to think about it.
Tom picked up the kids after school.
I couldn't have done that without you.
I couldn't have done this without you.
One by one the boys went out of the room.
In your situation, I'd be more polite. Who knows what might happen...
He's sitting next to his brother.
I caught sight of Namie Amuro.
Who are the people I saw her with?
But I'd like to learn more.
He as well as you is tired of this work.
I got a letter from her today.
What else do you have in your pocket?
What else do you have in your pocket?
Here's my number.
What did you do to me?
What have you done to me?
I don't need this book.
What has become of the book I put here a few minutes ago?
I have very long hair.
That's more than enough.
I can see the sea and the river.
Tom bugs everyone.
Is this your husband?
The floor is under my feet!
But father, what if something happens to you?
Tom doesn't want us to leave.
Who told you to do that?
I heard what happened.
Why am I still alive?
Tom got in the taxi.
What have we done?
Now she understands what I mean.
There are more than 4,000 languages in the world.
It's your problem, not mine.
It's your problem, not mine.
I can't tell you what I think.
I feel the same way.
Here is one of my pictures.
That's not my problem, Tom.
I have the same trouble as you had.
I had the same problem as you.
We had our reasons.
Really? I didn't know she was your sister.
He is stronger than me.
He is stronger than me.
We're not expecting your help.
What time shall I be there?
What time shall I be there?
Do you want to kill me?
Tom boarded the plane.
He decided not to go.
He decided not to go.
I think he's a great writer.
I couldn't find it anywhere.
I read books.
I don't need a doctor.
I don't need a reason.
This car is not mine.
This watch is ten minutes fast.
All I know is that I do not know everything.
My house is just across the street.
She's attracted to her husband's best friend.
I don't know whether the story is true or not.
It never happened.
Would you mind not doing that?
She knew the story already.
French is the language of love.
The sky became darker and darker.
I was very hungry.
I was very hungry.
The man looked at me.
The man looked at me.
When do you write?
I saw a girl with long hair.
You do nothing else but eat.
I didn't understand what he said.
I couldn't get a definite answer from him.
It has happened.
Don't ask for money.
She sat reading a book.
I don't know this game.
I don't know that word.
I don't know if I want to do that.
I don't know if I want to do that.
I have my own room.
I have my own room.
What's the name of your dog?
Tom knows it's true.
I asked him to be here by six.
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
He was all alone in the house.
She was alone in the house.
I'm coming to pick you up.
He turned out to be her father.
He thought I was my brother.
He died in her arms.
She died in his arms.
He died in my arms.
Happily, the workaholic did not die.
In short, all died out.
You aren't ready for this.
You haven't answered my question.
I'm not scared to die.
I'm no longer afraid of you.
I'm no longer afraid of you.
I fear no one.
I think he is a doctor.
Nobody wants to work outdoors on a cold day.
There were way too many people in the room.
The room was too crowded.
I don't remember that conversation.
This is not yours.
I thought you were dead.
I decided to buy a car.
Don't ask them where they are going.
Don't ask them where they are going.
It takes one to know one.
It takes one to know one.
Think about what I said to you.
That'll never happen to me.
I'm not privy to their decisions.
I'm glad to hear it!
I'm glad to hear it!
Maybe he was sick.
Maybe he was sick.
They need him.
Tom took his shoes and socks off.
Tom took the money off the table.
In the past, he lived, as it seems to me, in Spain.
Do you remember his name?
I saw five men.
Tom began to believe that he'd never be able to walk again.
I wish you had told me that.
Life without love has no meaning at all.
He is about to die.
Are there any letters for me?
I forgot, she answered.
Who is that man?
Do you have any siblings? "No, I'm an only child."
You're a good guy.
This carpet is very long.
I feel very ill.
There's no reason for me to stay.
Two days ago the wind blew.
I can run the fastest of the three.
He is at play.
That box is bigger than this one.
That box is bigger than this one.
Tell me all about your plan.
If I were you, I wouldn't do a thing like that.
I didn't know about it until I read the paper.
I didn't know whether to stay here or go to London.
If I go, you'll be all alone.
We did it ourselves.
I can't go with you tonight.
I don't know what I did wrong.
He was alone in the room.
He was alone in the room.
How could you do that?
He told her something and she smiled.
I wrote a long letter to him.
Large, isn't it?
Large, isn't it?
You don't want to talk about it at all, do you?
I stayed home.
What do you have in your pockets?
What do you have in your pockets?
It was his best time.
It was her best time.
How are you getting on with your work?
Please write to me once in a while.
At nights I read book for my son.
I said all I had to say.
Even I was defeated.
They both work.
Is it true that you were absent yesterday?
Mary can't get enough of it.
I thought you were on my side.
I thought you were on my side.
Something must have happened to him on the way.
Something must have happened to him on the way.
I saw something white in the park.
She's not ready.
He lives across the street.
He lives across the street.
She lives across the street.

That's what I'm talking about.
Yours is bigger than mine.
Yours is bigger than mine.
Yours is bigger than mine.
Yours is bigger than mine.
Yours is bigger than mine.
Yours is bigger than mine.
We should do this more often.
We should do this more often.
I wish it would happen more often.
That didn't even occur to me.
We don't need you.
We don't need him.
What you're saying now has nothing to do with the question.
I haven't seen it.
Do you want him to know about it?
Do you want him to know about it?
He talks as if he knows everything.
I pass the bank every day on the way to work.
We've been expecting rain for the past week.
They've finally paved our street.
You couldn't pay me to do that.
The food was highly peppered.
The girl wanted to tell him the truth, but she couldn't.
Nobody needs me.
That was then and this is now.
That was then and this is now.
She's taller than him.
She's taller than him.
You don't have a heart.
I also want to play.
I want to play.
This should be more than enough.
What'd the doctor say?
He's my best friend. It's like we are brothers.
Have you forgotten?
I have my own reasons.
She likes all of us.
I got up about six.
I caught the last bus.
Do you think anyone can see me?
Do you think anyone can see me?
Do you think anyone can see us?
Do you think anyone can see us?
Open your mouth.
I'm telling the truth.
It's been a long night.
I'm going out in an hour.
I leave in an hour.
Have we understood each other?
I'm reading the newspaper.
The women achieved their goal.
That's all you think about!
I wanted to go home.
I wanted to go home.
I wanted to go home.
I wanted to go home.
You've got a crush on this girl. "No, I don't!"
He can't possibly write the letter by himself.
Today, I'm not going to school.
I don't think we're ready.
I think I have the answer.
It's not what we want.
We express our thoughts by means of language.
Don't believe everything you read.
Do you believe war will start?
Do you know his brother?
Stop at the corner.
Stop at the corner.
I don't know what to do.
What was the boy called?
Don't you want to go out?
You're not yourself today.
You're not yourself today.
I'll tell you the truth now.
He is a strange man.
He's a very strange person.
She's a very strange person.
She's a very strange person.
Tom is a very odd person.
Betty killed them all.
What are you going to do tomorrow?
What are you going to do tomorrow?
Come here!
He can speak five languages.
Isn't that fantastic?
He tried his best, but in the end he was defeated.
The picture is in this book.
Why do they do it?
He came back two days later.
He will be back in an hour.
I didn't go to school last Monday.
I showed them how to do it.
I showed them how to do it.
They say that one look is worth more than thousand words.
Good-hearted women are always beautiful, but beautiful women are not always good-hearted.
Let Tom speak.
We can't stop.
His real name is Tom.
He took the heavy box down from the shelf.
Both his parents are dead.
The truth isn't always welcome!
Tom drinks quite a bit.
I'm very afraid.
I ate a hot dog for lunch.
Do as I told you.
Your little brother has the face of a slob!
There is a path through the wood.
Now you tell.
I'll do as you say.
I think Tom is sick.
She gave me a fake phone number.
They can't be right.
Show me your pockets.
Show me what's in your pocket.
This car is like new.
He is my husband's best friend.
That boy is running.
She witnessed him being killed.
You must always do what is right.
He was silent for quite a while.
I don't disagree with your decision.
Are your hands clean?
My brothers!
The weather couldn't have been better.
He ranges with the great writers.
Once in a while everything goes wrong.
I knew what Tom was doing.
Tell me when you're coming back home.
I go as often as I can.
Let the game begin.
At the moment, I have a pretty good job.
Didn't you go out?
This land is your land.
I need to know what I should tell Tom.
I can come at three.
We have enough money.
There was a calm wind yesterday.
She worked through the night.
They're going to the war.
This shower is broken.
Knowing you, I'm ready for anything.
I did what she'd asked me to.
This question is easy to answer.
Put the gun down.
Something happened here, but I don't know what.
I don't know why you need it.
I don't know why you need it.
I don't know why you didn't tell the truth.
I don't know why you didn't tell the truth.
I don't know why you did it.
I don't know why you did it.
Elizabeth was delighted.
Can you do it in thirty minutes?
There is no reason for this fear.
When did he return from Osaka?
What was she doing here?
Thank you very much!
I can't find the newspaper.
Some things are best left unsaid.
I am washing my brother's car.
I told you I don't want your help.
And you call this a meeting room?
Tom saved everybody.
I'm very happy for Tom.
Aren't I going crazy?
He arrived earlier than usual.
He arrived earlier than usual.
Cheer up.
It won't do any good.
I think we're taking three steps forward then two steps back.
He admired her.
This is all I can do for you.
This is all I can do for you.
Do it as you are told.
I hadn't heard about that.
I knew that was going to happen.
I haven't seen him for about three years.
We took the necessary measures.
My father told me to keep silent.
Were I younger and richer, you'd marry me.
Give it to me!
Give it to me!
I know him better than anybody.
I'll show you where it is.
I'll show you where it is.
I'll kill the both of you.
I'll kill the both of you.
I'll have to do it myself.
I'll have to do it myself.
This mountain isn't a lofty one.
If I were you, I wouldn't have done that.
My children are in school.
Michael gave it to Dora.
The boy opened the window, although his mother told him not to.
I thought I was going to die last night.
You can know a man by his friends.
She is taller than her sister.
No language, no nation.
Tell me about it!
What time are you going on duty?
Which class are you in?
It is time you went to school.
Tom needn't do it.
I thought you went home.
Even a child can answer it.
The War of 1812 had begun.
Could I see the room please?
You should have done so.
What did you open it with?
What did you open it with?
I don't know. It all happened so fast.
Do you want to be my friend?
Why did you buy it?
Why did you buy it?
Why did you buy this?
Why did you buy it?
Why did you buy it?
Tell me about your plan.
Have a nice evening.
I came here for that reason.
Can I open a can?
Make it smaller.
Make it smaller.
Make it smaller.
She believes him, whatever he says.
There are trees on either side of the river.
My boyfriend doesn't know.
He fixed the problem in a jiffy.
I need you right now.
I'm 25 years old.
I'll show you the way to the station.
There are many people who can do the same as you.
Today I didn't go to school, and neither did you.
That's what everyone does.
She had a crush on him.
Everyone is here except for him.
Tom didn't come to school yesterday.
That was very good.
He's as big as I am.
Is his father a doctor?
The pain is gone.
I know what might happen here.
This is Tom.
We can't help you unless you help us.
No one will have the heart to say it.
Are these my socks or your socks?
It's nearly seven o'clock. We have to go to school.
I waited for a bus to come.
You'd better go home at once.
She talks as if she knew everything.
The baby kept quiet.
Do it your own way.
I wish she could have come.
Show me another one.
I think it's time to write one more letter to my mother.
What, nobody has cassette players anymore?
Tom doesn't remember my name.
It just doesn't make sense anymore.
Why are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?
She saw a young man at the entrance.
He stood with his back to the wall.
If you want war, you'll get war.
Tom likes to stay home and read books on weekends.
He looked up at the night sky.
Tom is living with his parents.
Where are your books? "They are on the desk."
Each of us has his own hobby.
We watched the children play.
My father was already at home when I came back.
Let's compare his work with hers.
These are heavy.
These are heavy.
Where is my phone? "It's on my desk."
There are a lot of girls in the room.
There are a lot of girls in the room.
Tom and Mary were both sitting cross-legged on the floor.

Tell your friends about Tatoeba.
He was wondering the same thing.
I just want to be a normal person.
It has been snowing since this morning.
I have never seen a giraffe.
I ought to go there, but I won't.
I wouldn't mind some company.
You have to give me more time.
Some of these young people have legs twice as long as mine.
Everyone should have a hobby.
It is not because she is beautiful that I like her.
He's young, maybe too young.
Here is my phone number and email.
I give the floor to Dr. Tom.
I'm planning to leave for Europe next week.
I can help my brother.
Please stop it!
What would you like to buy?
How many phone numbers has she got?
This city was beautiful in its time.
Tom sat down at one of the tables.
Tom is talking in his sleep again.
I don't know when my mother will come back.
I'm the youngest in the family.
I want a book.
I took a book from the shelf.
I looked out the window.
I went to bed at one o'clock.
I often stay up all night.
I bought a lot of books.
It's hot today, isn't it?
Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.
In my view, you are wrong.
It's worth it.
It seems something's gone wrong.
Can this be true?
You have become a great man!
The answer was not correct.
You are not going to die here.
Can I find that?
Is that so bad?
Tom won't ask for help.
Answer the question!
I did everything Tom told me to do.
He died an unnatural death.
Do you really expect Tom to tell you the truth?
Yeah, I'm going to take tomorrow off.
What is your problem?
I think Tom left.
I won't forget what you did.
That child caused a lot of trouble.
Well, the night is quite long, isn't it?
Tom needs a doctor.
What will I write about today?
She always writes to her mother every week.
I wonder if Tom can hear us.
I just found out Tom is dead.
The child threw a stone at the dog.
That guy is a party pooper.
Are you glad to meet me?
Only time will tell.
Aren't we friends?
I am fine, and you?
Tom is one of my closest friends.
This is an old story.
She has finally reached the Arctic.
I'm your best friend.
I'm your best friend.
I don't know why Tom didn't come and I don't want to ask him.
Listen.
Listen.
What city are you in?
You know you want it!
Should I call an ambulance?
Why doesn't Tom answer?
We did what we had to do.
What were you doing in my house?
Take whatever you need.
Next time I'll come earlier.
It can't be worse than now.
Can we go upstairs?
This I didn't say.
It's not what it seems.
That wasn't what Tom meant.
Can't you go faster?
Tom decided to be a firefighter.
Tell us more.
I know a shortcut.
I can follow the rules.
I want a room for tonight.
I don't know if she will come or not.
He did nothing but read newspapers.
No other boy in our class is more studious than Jack.
Tom has been reading a book all afternoon.
Doesn’t what’s-her-name have the same car?
What's today's plan?
I don't get it either.
It's easy to say, but not to do.
Please tell me how to do that.
You have no right to say so.
Betty sat in the chair with her legs crossed.
Isn't it good to have friends?
When are you planning to begin?
The pain was worse than he could stand.
I believe in myself.
This question is very simple.
He is a man of intellect.
They're over there, you know, with their dog.

What are you doing today?
I don't know exactly when she'll come.
Have you been to Kyoto?
Have you been to Kyoto?
Tom recognized me.
I'm waiting for your letter.
They became more and more nervous.
My mother cooks skillfully.
However, the moment was not very appropriate.
I don't know exactly at what time she's coming.
Women usually live 10 years longer than men do.
Tom yelled loud enough for everyone to hear.
I'll get it through in a couple of minutes.
I just received your letter.
I have to explain this to Tom.
It is ten years since I saw her last.
Everyone was smiling.
I am nobody's enemy.
He was killed by my hand.
There are things I have to know about.
There's something I should know.
There is something you must know.
I never really was on your side.
That CD is my son's.
Everybody was anxious to know what had happened.
This baby is 3 weeks old.
It's the voice of an old woman.
Tom is a very strong man.
Tom is the tallest one in the class.
Do you know it?
Do you know about that?
I don't want to talk about my family.
I don't need a car.
It's hard to explain.
Listen to your heart.
It was their fault.
These are my parents.
She's not like other girls.
In short, he was wrong.
I can do this alone.
What long hair you've got!
The most common first name in the world is Mohammed.
Call a spade a spade.
It was predictable.
I'll explain this later.
Tom isn't like the other boys.
Why didn't you come?
They need to work tomorrow.
Nancy is the tallest girl in her class.
Let's call a bus.
Tom! Are you all right?
I live alone in this house.
I told you I could do it.
There is a village over the mountain.
I told you I could do it.
He is not my father but my uncle.
Come with us.
Someone's in my room.
Are you listening, Tom?
Do you believe in destiny?
Do we have enough time?
Tom said he had a plan.
Tom was my friend, too.
Tom wasn't very hungry.
Tom isn't feeling very well.
Tom will agree with me.
We need your help, Tom.
We need one more chair.
Tom is tall.
Tom wouldn't believe me.
Tom would've understood.
Tom would agree with me.
What have you done with him?
What have you done with her?
Where are we going, Tom?
Why didn't you write me?
Why didn't you write me?
Why aren't you laughing?
Why aren't you laughing?
Why aren't you in school?
Do you remember that day?
Do you know what Tom did?
Do you know what Tom did?
Sometimes miracles come to see people.
Do you believe in miracles? You don't? But they believe in you.
It wasn't so difficult.
How do you feel, Tom?
I never said that to you.
They arrived here in 1997.
I know we're different.
He's my best friend. We're like brothers.
You ought not to have done that.
Tom needs a friend.
Tom is very strong.
Tom can explain it.
Tom is our enemy.
The Aztecs spoke Nahuatl.
It's not quite normal.
I can't forget about what has happened.
I was astonished that she had done it.
My friend Marcelo writes in Latin.
Tell me why you were absent from school yesterday.
Every road leads to the end of the world.
How did you get in my house?
How old must a child be to be able to stay at home alone?
If that happens, you'll be the first to be notified.
Give me some water, and make it quick!
I was the one who suggested it.
I'm writing a letter to my daughter.
That's a good response.
I don't like doctors.
The cat is reading a book.
No, we'll never become humans!
Tom wanted to say something, but he felt that it would be better if he didn't.
It'll get worse.
Why was Tom frightened?
I eat here.
You may bring whoever wants to come.
I eat with my hands.
I don't believe Naomi. I think she's lying.
Do you like school?
Do you like school?
We'll go after we eat.
He never asked me.
Is the cat all right?
I'd like some cheese.
Can you give me your phone number?
It was all a dream.
May I introduce my friend to you?
We're working here, and he's just watching.
What are you laughing about?
This house is a very beautiful one.
I am a good boy.
I'm a good guy.
The fault is not mine but yours.
I know him, but I don't know his name.
I'm ready to go.
He is sitting on the chair.
Why don't you tell me about it?
Why don't you tell me about it?
I will write you tomorrow.
Why do you believe others' words?
Where's he wandering about?
If you see, let me know.
Why do you believe others' words?
Did you know that he's good at making coffee?
I don't drink coffee at all.
Columbus discovered America.
We'll be in touch.
It's your fault, not mine.
It's your fault, not mine.
Somebody was in the house.
I can't give those to you.
Somebody is here to see you, Tom.
There's someone here to see you.
There's someone here to see you.
I don't remember anyone named Tom.
Believe me. I'll be a new man.
I don't remember anyone named Tom.
Write the answer in English, please.
I'll be with you as soon as I can.
We must do away with such a custom.
I am yelling at the top of my voice!
Without your help, I couldn't have done it.
Had it not been for your help, I couldn't have done it.
Had it not been for your help, I couldn't have done it.
Without your help, I couldn't have done it.
He asked his friends for help.
I'm not going to give you my phone number.
Do as you think fit.
Do as you think fit.
Do what you think is right.
Try not to think about it.
Try not to think about it.
I see things differently now.
She speaks seven languages.
Where were you when it happened?
Where were you when it happened?
Where were you when it happened?
I'm not like I used to be.
I'm not like I used to be.
Let's pretend this never happened.
Look at me and do what I do.
I don't believe in fate.
Tom quickly opened the letter.
They were on their knees.
The man left the restaurant without paying.
The man left the restaurant without paying his bill.
Let's leave it as it stands.
All the stories are interesting.
You're a good boy, Tom.
I don't want to tell Tom the truth.
We rented the apartment.
The woman eats bread.
We don't have enough money for a taxi.
I want the class to be silent.
Kneel!
Okay, who are you?
I can't pass the test.
There is no response from him.
I'm not against it, but I'm not for it, either.
Get out of my car.
What are you driving at?
There's no life on the moon.
These books are mine.
That's very motherly of you.
Some people read books to kill time.
Tom opened the box.
Tom decided not to go.
Smile.
Smile.
Monday is my busiest day.
No one in his class is faster than he is.
They're going crazy.
You want to kill me.
You want to kill me.
They want to kill me.
What do you want me to do?
Tom didn't agree.
I didn't do it for you.
I didn't do it for you.
I didn't do it for you.
Do you want to know more?
Are you going to stay here in Rio?
Together we can do it!
That's quite possible.
No one went near him.
But why did you do it?
As if!
Today's Monday, isn't it?
I tried to help Tom, but I couldn't.
Tom just doesn't listen.
Tom went straight home after work.
He threw the letter into the fire.
I truly regret having to tell you this.
Tell Tom not to take all of this medicine at once.
Because dogs are more faithful than cats.
I wish Tom had left a note.
I don't know what "twerking" is and I don't care.
People do that all the time.
Why aren't you all laughing?
That's what Tom had in mind.
Do you remember our meetings?
We had sex once and his wife found out.
While getting off the bus, she heard her name called.
Please don't tell anybody about this.
Didn't I tell you?
I guess this desk will serve the purpose until we can get a new one.
Do as you please. It makes no difference to me.
Can you put up some extra guests for the night?
Please point out the articles you want to buy.
May I have another book in place of this one?
That must have taken place while I was away.
The table can be placed over there for now.
The car pulled up in front of the house.
I was paid well on my previous job.
That'll be enough for the present.
That hotel serves good plain food.
Put the book back in place.
Point to the one you mean.
Put it in your pocket.
He who can, does. He who cannot, teaches.
Everytime her husband looked at me, he almost asked me: "For what purpose have you come here?"
I furnished him with food.
Can you come for dinner tonight?
My mother is a good woman.
Please come into the room.
Can I sit here?
Can I sit here?
A lot of people are waiting to see what is going to happen.
If I'd known the truth, I'd have told you.
They are seeking a solution.
Where did you write this letter?
Where did you write this letter?
Let us think about it together and dream a little.
I work every day except Sunday.
In this world, it's difficult to go on behaving like a human being.
I'm on the road.
She's on her way.
She's working on it.
I have been in Paris.
Why am I doing this?
Tom wants to understand the meaning of life.
Won't you come with me?
Tom is at school.
Tom is back again.
There are some beautiful parks in this city.
She spoke scarcely a word of English.
The bottle smashed to pieces.
Your house is three times as big as mine.
Your house is three times as big as mine.
I don't know what to answer.
I don't know that.
He has his own room.
He has his own room.
He said he did not want to be president.
I don't know any more than you do.
I don't know any of these people.
Some know about the old times from their parents only.
You can believe him.
Such people are few in number.
I don't know how else to explain it.
Emily answered the question right.
How's it going at school?
I'm at home every evening.
It's a bargain.
I know who it was.
She died a few years ago.
Would you like to be famous?
Anyone knows his own name, but nobody remembers his own face.
If he comes, what should I tell him?
The paintings were in very good condition.
Your time has come.
Your time is limited.
Your time will come.
You're going to be seen.
You're going to be a father.
You're exactly right, Tom.
Would that have made it better?
Would you get that, please?
Would you like one now?
Why's Tom doing that?
Why would Tom stay?
Why would that be awkward?
Why would that be easier?
Why would they think that?
Why would Tom be different?
Why would someone do this?
Why not get a job?
Why is Tom running?
Why is Tom leaving?
Why is Tom laughing?
Why would Tom think that?
Why did Tom come back?
Why don't we take it with us?
Why does Tom do it?
Why do you think Tom did that?
Why do you think this is happening?
Why do you think that was?
Why do you think it happened?
Why do you take that medicine?
Why do you do what you do?
Why didn't you think of that?
Why didn't you go get it?
Why did you do what you did?
Why did you do what you did?
Why are you being so reluctant?
Why are we going to Australia?
Why are they so afraid?
Who's making the decisions?
Who would know that?
Who would do this?
Who said we were going to die?
What's that got to do with this?
What's that all about?
What's this got to do with me?
What's this got to do with us?
What're you going to do with that?
What're you going to do with all this?
What're you going to do now?
What're you doing up here?
What'll you do there?
What does Tom think he's doing?
What do you think Tom would've said?
What do you think Tom will do?
What do you think Tom means?
What do you think Tom is doing?
What do you think Tom did wrong?
We had a little argument.
We were all very thirsty.
We're not ready for this.
We're the only ones left.
What have you discovered?
What did Tom have to say?
What have you heard, Tom?
You need to listen to me.
You must've been wrong.
I have an appointment with the doctor.
Will she be back home at five?
Do you want to keep somebody far from you?
As I was in a hurry, I had to take a taxi.
We can't be seen together.
I can't help you with this.
I can't help you with this.
You have to go to school from Monday to Friday.
I will stay until tomorrow.
I have enough money to buy this book.
I have enough money to buy this book.
I have enough money to buy this book.
You can believe her.
I hadn't planned to tell you about what happened last night.
If you're going away for a day, take food for three days.
Naoko can run fast.
I do it because I want to.
How old was he?
How old was she?
Why are you bleeding?
Forget about the past, live the present, think about future.
A twink performed a blowjob on me.
Please stand by, homing in on your position.
What's the point in doing that?
I didn't know that.
I wanted to know the truth.
The answer's yes.
The answer's no.
This is your decision.
That's your business.
My son believes in Santa Claus.
You understand what I mean, don't you?
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I wish you had told me the truth.
I wish you had told me the truth.
I wish you had told me the truth.
I wish you had told me the truth.
I don't like school.
What school did you go to?
What school did you go to?
Except for Sundays, he works every day.
I like this answer.
I'm looking for a place to sleep.
No one knows what has happened to him.
We're ready for them.
Go when you want.
I like my life.
I like my life.
Why didn't you come earlier?
He never laughs.
What do you think, Tom?
Had it not been for his help, I should have failed.
The wind is cold today.
My real name has nothing to do with my nickname.
Write what I say!
That's exactly what I wanted.
You were there, weren't you?
You were there, weren't you?
Let me know when you're back home.
I forgot to ask your name.
What have you done to them?
What've you done to her?
What have you done to him?
Try to be yourself.
Guys are predictable.
I decided to stay one more day.
Why did you leave like that?
I don't even know if he has a girlfriend.
I don't even know if she has a boyfriend.
Just do as I say.
There was a time when I listened only to this songs continuously for days.
I'd like to work for you as long as possible.
Why did Tom do it?
Can you come tomorrow?
You brought some water.
Tom, can you come tomorrow?
Can Tom come tomorrow?
The jets took off one after another.
You could have told me.
Let's return to the hotel.
What were you thinking of?
What were you thinking of?
I am not your son.
I don't remember what happened anymore.
I don't see what's wrong with that.
He kept at the job all day.
That country is about twice as large as Japan.
This book is not as large that one.
I was home all day yesterday.
All you have to do is to tell the truth.
I don't think I'm ready for a relationship.
I'm waiting for the right man.
I'm waiting for the right woman.
Why do bad things happen?
I've been with him for a long time.
A friend told me about Tatoeba.
Zelda, the floor is under my feet! "I know!"
I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
Why can't I just have a normal boyfriend? Why? Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me! "Everybody wants that, dear. It doesn't exist."
There was a light burning in the window.
I have not felt well recently.
The people's hardships are our hardships.
You can stay here till the snow stops.
The story takes place in Lisbon.
How many rooms are there in this hotel?
How many more of these do we need?
How much of this does Tom know?
How much more of this do you think you can take?
How long sentence do you think Tom will pass on me for this?
How much are you asking?
We should call the police.
It's your turn soon, Bashar!
Do you like any of these pictures?
Tom can't even write his own name.
I like the Harry Potter books.
You may not believe it, but sometimes I want to give up everything and run away.
Get them while you can.
That's a good school.
Life goes by pretty fast.
You never told me that! "Yes, I did!"
This isn't about you, Tom.
This isn't about you.
You're not very good at it.
How could you know that?
We need to work together in order to make the world a better place.
I think you know why I summoned you.
It's pure escapism.
When was your last day off?
Stop right there, Tom.
Let me think about it.
I don't understand what you are talking about.
I wanted her to come here this evening.
We're on earth to look for happiness, not to find it.
I'm trying to help you.
I don't want to eat here.
I don't work on Mondays.
Don't be a bad boy.
Women like men with mustaches.
Shouldn't you go home?
I'll do it if I have to.
I completely forgot about Tom.
I completely forgot about Tom.
They lived in the countryside during the war.
Write your name.
Is that really Tom?
The wind calmed down in the evening.
Is more always better?
I fail to see the reason.
I can't die yet.
Just look at him.
Tatoeba is not my girlfriend.
Who will try this case?
Who do you think did this?
We've got our own problems.
Why haven't you replied to me for so long?
How do you like Texas so far?
Why don't you just tell us what's on your mind?
I want to buy the same car that Tom wants to buy.
That's pretty normal.
Is this the reason you didn't want to come with me?
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
The book I bought is on the table.
I don't want you to think about it anymore.
I don't want to talk about my child.
No one wants to be the last, but everyone wants to be the first.
He asked for some money.
I'll not forget that.
This is not the America I know and love.
Tom knows the man Mary came with.
I'll always remember the first time I saw her.
I don't live in this city.
She knows what you did.
I am afraid of dying.
Tom answered all of Mary's questions.
There's no tomorrow for these people.
Tom has just left.
You're wanted on the phone.
I know exactly where he is.
I know exactly where he is.
May I have the check, please?
I'll have to do it myself.
I'll have to do it myself.
They haven't arrived yet.
A part of me died with you, but you live inside me forever.
Tom would say yes.
My response remains the same.
It seems pretty easy.
Are you a girl or a boy?
We won't tell anybody about that.
I'll explain it all to you later.
Yes, I said that, but I was wrong.
The father abandoned us.
This is what the law says.
But that's another story entirely.
English is a language.
What's Tom doing right now?
You should be at home with your wife.
I'd like to know that too.
Do you know what caused the problem?
I'll always remember the first time I saw him.
I know exactly where Tom is.
Tom got out of his car and unlocked the gate.
What time will you be back home?
Do you even recall me?
He can do it well, and you can do it even better.
You are so beautiful. What are you doing this evening?
Do you write to him at all even now?
How do you know I even want that job?
She knows what you did.
Would it be OK if I asked you a personal question?
Wow, that line is huge!
Something seems to be wrong with this watch.
That's quite enough.
Life on earth may be expensive.
She has to drink water.
In many ways time is more valuable than money.
You're the woman of my dreams.
I don't know why he said that to me.
I did it three years ago.
I did it three years ago.
My mother is like a friend to me.
They need friends.
Let me say what I think.
Let me say what I think.
Did you receive my letters?
I want us to be friends.
I want us to be friends.
What's happened? "The speakers aren't working properly."
I wanna find something like that.
What were you planning to do?
Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much.
What are you looking at me for?
There's no one around.
We're not in high school anymore.
How much of this did you write?
How much of this are you responsible for?
He is a good listener but a poor speaker.
It's my father who stopped drinking.
Emet dislikes that woman.
We're on earth to look for happiness, not to find it.
I love my father.
My little brother did it, not me.
Thanks for the help.
She couldn't understand what had happened there.
I would die for you.
She was impossible to ignore.
He always thinks ten steps ahead.
Can they die?
I know exactly where she is.
Would you like to come over for dinner after work on Monday?
Does this path lead to the train station?
His body is perfect.
This is not the America I want for my children.
It could attack us at any moment.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
Give these children three pieces each.
When are you coming to the Netherlands?
I was too sick to go to school yesterday.
We've never been to that place.
I don't like being told what to do.
I want to be free.
My cake didn't rise.
Why does anyone learn Esperanto?
Neither he nor she sings well.
The enemy of "good" is "better".
Maybe the voices in my head aren't right after all.
It's time to go back home.
Her body is perfect.
He was a jihadist.
He was a jihadist.
I'm going back home tomorrow.
There is someone in this room.
There is someone in this room.
Tom walked through the metal detector.
I want to do something with my life.
Stay where you are. I'm on my way.
I'll always remember the first time I saw you.
I'll always remember the first time I saw her.
What time will you be back?
This has never happened before.
Are you a man or a woman?
Where were you? I've been looking for you for a long time.
My favorite part of the Appassionata is the second movement.
He was deeply moved by the story.
They will hold a meeting at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
During his time in high school, Tom became anorexic.
In Japan, it's three in the morning now.
Do you know where my watch is?
Emet doesn't like that woman.
You're the reason I came.
Why didn't you replied to me?
We'd better go home now.
There's something under the bed.
Can I say it in this way as well? "Yes, that's fine too."
What do you do exactly?
You're not very hungry, are you?
Are you planning on buying a car?
Are you planning on buying a car?
That's your car.
Do you really need a car?
Tom is good at his profession.
Why don't you believe me?
Who do you think that man is?
I think you like your job.
How much does this book cost?
To go faster you'd better go alone, to go further you'd better go with someone.
They do it each week.
I was working all night.
Give me some water, be so kind.
She speaks good English.
Stay here and wait for her.
That was my first thought.
Remember what I said to you yesterday.
Jim is not what he was.
Tom took his socks off.
Wait, what are you doing here?
Do you believe in miracles?
Do you believe in miracles?
Don't you believe in miracles?
Don't you believe in miracles?
I haven't got books.
Aren't you afraid?
Tom can't write yet.
Tom still can't read.
I'd rather die than do it!
I haven't read "War and Peace" either.
She left an hour ago so she should've arrived by now.
I'm making waffles.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
By the time I came, he'd gone away.
Mayuko went right home.
I thought Tom was your friend.
I told you to keep silent.
I find what you say of no use to myself.
Do you think I'm too old to get back to school?
There's no reason.
Tell me the truth.
Why did you stay?
The night was long.
I like that dog.
I would like to buy.
Indeed!
I was on close terms with him.
What problems are you planning to resolve next year?
We managed to get along.
Next year we'll recur to this issue.
We can't stand apart. We ought to do something.
Make love, not war!
A bad beginning makes a bad ending.
He stood with his hands in his pockets.
He stood with his hands in his pockets.
I didn't get the job.
Your dog was born this year.
I've come here to work with Tom.
Why didn't he come?
What a pity it is that you can't come!
You are quite a man.
You shouldn't talk back to your parents like that.
I wish you had told me the truth then.
I came as soon as I could.
Your book is on the desk.
I guess that you can't do it.
I would like you to come with me.
I would like you to come with me.
I would like you to come with me.
My grandson cries very loud.
When he came, I was writing a letter.
Listen well to what I say.
I know you've got some problems with your mother.
Do you get it? "Now I do".
He does much to help others.
Yesterday was cloudy.
What do you like to do on Sundays?
I do not want to talk about it anymore.
He's a boy, and she's a girl.
Tom doesn't know how to explain it.
I can speak Esperanto like a native.
I'm trying to help you become a better person.
I'd like to be left alone.
I'm doing this job to help a friend.
If you don't believe me, have a look yourself!
The medicine didn't help at all.
She asked me if I have a web cam.
Can you follow me?
Have you ever returned home before seven?
You bought bread.
You bought bread.
She texted him.
I have a solution in mind.
She sat down next to him and listened quietly.
I don't know how she does it.
Why did she do that?
It was just a one-nighter.
He showed his mother around the city.
I'm not afraid of you, Tom.
I'm going to open the wine.
My brother has an Xbox.
But I wasn't afraid.
I want you to go.
There is one thing I've never told you: I'm a superbeing!
Why aren't you going? "Because I don't want."
He is always on my side.
I have twice as many books as he.
You've succeeded where others have failed.
You've succeeded where others have failed.
You've succeeded where others have failed.
You're very different from us.
You're very different from us.
You're very different from us.
You're very different from us.
You're very different from us.
You're very different from us.
You've probably done this many times before.
You've barely said a word all night.
You've barely said a word all night.
You've definitely gotten stronger.
You've definitely gotten stronger.
I don't think it's weird at all.

Tom is a big boy.
Tom drank directly from the wine bottle.
Tom finished his coffee and left for work.
Leave the book where it was.
That's the point.
Ten years have gone by.
Either we all go or nobody goes.
He was holding a large box in his arms.
I'm here. Is there anybody home?
I was able to find the book I was looking for.
I agreed with her.
Bill is completely unlike his brother.
Think about your life.
Think about the ones you love.
Think about it, OK?
These people are our guests.
You're in my seat.
We seized the town after a short battle.
Tom sincerely believes that story.
Tom never smiles.
Tom knows the Secretary of State.
Tom is still a small boy.
Tom is a rather smart child.
Tom hasn't been here since Monday.
They stood in line, waiting their turn.
There's no sense in doing that.
The work here is fairly simple.
The sea was very smooth.
That perfume smells good.
Sit down over here, won't you?
Since you don't believe me, look for yourself.
See what can be done about it.
May I be seated?
Let's stop at the next service station.
I've searched everywhere for a small apartment.
I want to stay for several days.
I see what you mean.
I didn't understand a single word Tom said.
Does Tom have a civil service job?
Do you sense something unusual?
Come to see me tomorrow.
Can't you drive a little more slowly?

I'm looking for your sister. Where is she?
Has she come or what?
I didn't recognize her.
I am older than your brother.
I'm very fat.
I sometimes dream of my mother.
That's not what this is about.
I know as little as you do.
Tom was holding something in his right hand.
Thank you for your letter!
Are you ready to begin?
If you don't go, I will not go either.
I am in your hands.
We are expecting the publication of his book.
This isn't my job.
Take whichever you like best.
Take whichever you like best.
Take whichever you want.
Take whichever you want.
Tom drove home.
No matter how tired I might be, I have to work.
What beautiful teeth you have!
He will have written a letter.
It was the worst day of my life.
I'm glad to hear it.
The cat played with the live mouse.
Don't leave us.
Don't leave us.
What does she do in the evening?
I can't live without you. You're the only woman for me.
Why did you open the box?
Why should he leave?

Live free or die.
Let's just keep this between us.
Tom is calling his mother.
Tom is running.
I went there.
I can't tell you what happened.

What you don't see and hear with your own ears and eyes might be true, but it might also not be true.
You don't seem very satisfied.
To me, it is easier writing about death than about life.
Are those the people you saw yesterday?

The trouble is that you are too young.
We sat together in silence for some time.
Do you know that hotel?

That's the correct answer.
Has Tom come?

They're not my enemies.
Do you really want that?
Nobody likes being laughed at.
If you ask him, he will help you.
He always believes me.
Tom made it clear that he didn't want me here.
I don't know if you found one.
Tom will get it.
What did you see at that time?
I can do whatever I like.
Where are you going to go?

The girl has a soft heart.
I've been working on this all day.
Thank you so much.
Tom doesn't want to hear this.
How deep is your love?
Tom asked me if I wanted another beer.

Thank you for that.

Frankly speaking, I don't care for her very much.
All those books are mine.
I'll be ready in a few minutes.
I'll be ready in a few moments.
Why don't you just go home?
Tom is teaching English.
I brought my son with me.
I brought my son with me.
Do I have to tell you again?
She will stay for 5 days.
I was conscripted into the army.
This book isn't as heavy as that one.
Tom looks like you.
I've written three letters.
Did you hear about what happened last night?
It's been a hard year.
It's been a hard year.
Tom just found out today that he is HIV positive.
Let him go hungry.
She replied that she had never seen the man before.
I can't eat all this.
I can't eat this kind of food.
I can't eat this kind of food.
I can't eat this.
I owe a lot of money.
I left as soon as I could.
I must have misunderstood.

It seems that no one knew the truth.
Those shoes are old fashioned.
It is no use going there.

This is exactly what I want.
This is what I want.
The question is who will do it.
Have you been told when to come?
Have you been told when to come?
Tom didn't use to like red wine, but now he drinks it almost every day.
I'm taking a couple of days off.
So how's it going in Egypt?
Do you know what he did?
Do you know what he did?
The soldiers are ready for battle.
I studied before supper.
Just a moment ...
Come on any day you like.
Come on any day you like.
Tom is really sorry.
I scarcely think so.
They're coming here.
You will stay with me.
How many people live in that house?
Take only one.
Take only one.
Take only one.
Take only one.
Take only one.
Take only one.
What's the name of your son?
Why would you need to know that?
Why do you want to know?
I wasn't listening.
I tried not to laugh.
She arrived in a car.
Tom, stop it, OK?
You have to do your job.
Tom abandoned his wife and children.
Where's your family?
I don't think it's worth it.
Is there a connection?
Do you know how this machine works?
Tom can never get my name right.
Not everybody knows about the plan.
What are you trying to do?
The boy talks as if he were a girl.
I don't normally do this.
I should've done it by myself.
I should've done it by myself.
I had to do it by myself.
I had to do it by myself.
I had to do that.
I should've done it by myself.

If I had had more time, I would have written to you.
His wife is one of my friends.
Thank you for the tea.
We've already done that.
Who was it?
They don't care.
Here's the plan.
What did you do with that car?
What did you do with that car?
Write me.
Write me.
Write to me.
Write to me.
She's my wife.
Here's your mug.
They were yours.
You're going to laugh.

Where is Namibia?
Was the soup tasty?
Is this your phone?
Who are your closest friends?
I feel a pain in my back.
You slept with her! "I did not."
Did I forget to mention that?
I've never been asked for anything like this.

That's good, isn't it?
What do you want to hear?
How big you've gotten!
How big you've gotten!
Tom's laughing.
Don't think about that anymore.
Some people are for the plan and others are against it.
I like my job.
Tom doesn't look like his father.
Don't think about that anymore.
Ask around.
Ask around.
I can do this.
Yesterday it snowed.
Let's get off the bus.
She sleeps with her boss.
You see what I mean?
I can't afford it.
Have another.

It's to your advantage.
Can I see you again?
Can I see you again?
Have a look at that picture.
Look at that picture.
Look at the picture.

She has twenty children.
He seems to be honest.
I have no weapons.
You don't have to come.
You don't have to come.
Where are you staying?
I just can't do this anymore.
They spent a lot of time together.
I think Tom is afraid of you.
And then, what did you do?
And then, what did you do?
And then, what did you do?
I want the biggest cake.
I thought you'd left.
Don't be mean.
This hall was full of people.
At last he found out the truth.
I'm not taking no for an answer.
I want to come here next winter again.
He has white teeth.
Have you arrived yet?
We don't want you to die.
We don't want you to die.
We don't want you to die.
Doesn't it taste good?

She's all right.

Did you make it for yourself?
Did you make it for yourself?
Stand up.
I wouldn't do it.
I'll ask him.
Tom is the only one who can help you now.
Somebody has to go for help.
Is she staying at a hotel?
Is she staying at a hotel?
I am playing a browser game.
I'd like my old job back.
I'm starting to like you.
Do you know why Tom did it?
Do you know why Tom did it?
I'll keep my mouth shut.
She made up her face in 20 minutes.
I am going out to buy the newspaper.
I am going out to buy the newspaper.
Tom didn't know what to do.
I'll ask you these questions.
He decided to go there.
Stay at home.
I waited for her as long as two hours.
Stay at home.
You will stay at home.
I do understand.
I have often heard him say that.
He is the love of her life.
She is the love of his life.
What did he do yesterday?
Tom told me he sleeps with the window open.
Nobody noticed Tom leave the room.
She's the woman I told you about.
I'd like to say a few words.
Tom took his glasses off and put them in his pocket.
But my friends will laugh at me!
You're my friend.

I came for you.
It's you I've come for.
Don't do that ever again!
Who did you come with?
Who did you come with?
The car is yellow.
The chairs are under the tree.
We have three planes.
I don't know who wrote this letter.
That would be unprofessional.
Last night I had a strange dream.
Would you like to live in Mumbai?
Would you like to live in Mumbai?
I knew you'd go there.
I knew you'd go there.
We must go now.
I want to go to Italy.
I was sick.
I was sick.
The woman stopped and looked at him.
Why did they do this?
Why did they do it?
You know that, don't you?
You know that, don't you?
I know it myself.
I know it myself.
Let's get out of the taxi.
She put her head against his chest.
We smell with our noses.
This city is not for me.
I'll tell you the truth now.
I don't speak any Esperanto at all.
Tom is a hero.
The only language I can speak fluidly is English.
I'd like you to be my partner.
What memory!
Tom lives in an apartment not far from my place.
Will you come to town?
It could happen.
Do you remember what happened last time?
He left his children.
What was I thinking?
Tom has a point here.
Tom has a point here.
I may know someone who can help you.
I may know someone who can help you.
I thought Tom was your friend.
What a big number!
That's what I always do.
Does it have any sense?
Tom took the wrong bus.
Why aren't you smiling?
Did I hurt his feelings?
I like none of them.
They don't know about it.
Did Tom come here yesterday?
How's your shoulder?
How's your shoulder?
I had to run to the station.
Why don't you ask him?
Why don't you ask him?
Why don't you ask him?
Why don't you ask him?
Why don't you ask him?

Why don't you ask her?
Why don't you ask her?

Why don't you ask her?
Tom is alive.
I pretended that I didn't care.
Everybody knew it, but I didn't care.
She's not stronger than me.
She's not stronger than me.
I was writing a letter when he came.
She's making fun of you.
We need to look at the big picture.
I'd rather stay here than go there.
They know her.
I don't think they believe us.
You should call the police.
He likes to do everything for himself.
I bought the book.
I bought the book.
The kids are at school.
I don't think this is the best time for us to talk.
The cat is writing a book.
Do you play with my shoes?
Do you play with my shoes?
Tom has been told several times not to do that.
I never had a car.
Love if you want to be loved.
Why would anybody come here?
You never ask.
You think I'm fat, don't you?
This is the car I spoke of the other day.
You're still alive.
You're still alive.
You're still alive.
I'm 25 years old and I've never had a girlfriend.
I never read the book.
I can be there in ten minutes.
To drink or not to drink - that is the question.
We've got everything under control.
What are you doing next Monday?
You heard what your father said.
Thank you for your attention.
We don't want to do this.
There's a letter for you.
Tell Tom that I need his help.
I see that you properly understood Kafka, maybe even better than he understood himself.
Not that I dislike the work, but that I have no time.
The two qualities are mutually exclusive.
Let's take an X-ray just in case.
I can't understand what he is trying to say.
I understand what you're trying to say.
I understand what you're trying to say.
Tom is as big as I am.
Don't talk about business while we're dining.
Tom didn't look like a freak.
Her heart is as good as gold.
Your memory is good.
You have a good memory.
To know a language is one thing, and to teach it is another.
Why do I have to do this?
Please just get out of my way.
Tom is no more suspicious than anybody else.
The box is heavy.
Tom was born on a plane.
I'll be there in a couple of hours.
The most beautiful girls are from Lithuania.
Would you give me your phone number?

He's scared of that dog.
I will be here from Monday to Thursday.
I was the one who killed your brother.
Do you believe that God exists?
They believe it.
I thought Tom was your brother.
It's easier said than done.
I studied for perhaps two hours.
Is the head a part of the body?
Was Tom still there?
I was thinking of the same thing.
Forget about it, OK?
Forget about it, OK?
Forget about it, OK?
Forget about it, OK?
Forget about it, OK?
Forget about it, OK?
I will go at 10.
I will go at 10.
Tom and I walked together.
I'm responsible for everything.
Leave that there.
Leave it here.
Leave that there.
I'm not good at math.
It was easy for them to find a hotel.
I'm trying to find out what happened.
Have you seen the paper?
Have you seen the paper?
Tom was the last person to see Mary alive.
Do you know Murphy's law?
To love and to be loved is the greatest happiness.
Can you recollect his name?
Tom went out the window.
My sister likes Ultraman.
I really am glad you're here.
I went to Lanzarote last year.
Can you tell us your name?
I can't figure out how to solve this problem.
I'm so fat.
You know Tom was right.
Tom said if I wanted to stay, I could.
If I could, I would read all the time.
Did you or did you not accept the bribe?
He was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
I received her letter the other day.
She wants to meet him again.
Where's my room?
That can happen.
That could happen.
She likes attention.
Her hair was similar in color to mine.
Why do you want to go to Turkey?
Taro, could you help me?
I couldn't do it.
I'll do anything that Tom asks.
You owe me a beer.
You owe me a beer.
You owe me a beer.
You have to help us.
You have to help us.
You have to help us.
You know quite a lot about Sumo.
Somebody answered.
Tom wouldn't want that.
What do you want to do this time next week?
I'm going to make some bread.
Ken and his brother are very alike.
Tom is unable to do this.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
How many were on the plane?
We're very different.
That has to be a misprint.
Is that my mug?
I know exactly what to do.
Who are they cheering for?
We're cheering for "Spartacus"!
Judy smiled at me.
I think we all know why we're here.
Why did this occur?
She'll probably come.
We had to drive slowly all the way.
No one comes to visit me anymore.
I got her phone number.
I need you now.
This is not a job that a woman can do.
All the people who were here have left.
You're not the only one who wants to leave.
Your short hair suits you.
It's your money, isn't it?
Can I go there now?
Can I go there now?
I would rather stay at home than go alone.
Where can I buy books?
It took me three hours to write the letter.
I took out a loan in order to buy a car.
How old are you? I'm twenty-six.
Tom was in New York at the time.
You don't really want that, do you?
Why would I be friends with him?
This problem is too difficult for me to solve.
Please, let me speak!
When are you going to ask her?
The whole class was quiet.
It must be true what they say.
He will kill himself if he doesn't see his child.
Where's Tom going to stay?
What're you working on?
His name isn't Tom.
Have you given Tom what he asked for?
You never told me your girlfriend's name.
I almost forgot to tell you why I'm here.
I have a Me 2, which is stronger than my Me 1.
It's okay to go.
What are you smiling at?
I thought this was mine.
I'm afraid Tom will say no.
It gets worse.
They say that every problem has a solution.
He is twice as heavy as his wife.
Do what's right!
She thinks of her boss as a father.
This is the first time I've ever understood something in that language.
I remember those days.
Tom chose to stay.
I'm not going to do it.
It's a long way to the station.
This girl is my girlfriend.
My nose is bleeding.
You named your dog Rex, didn't you?
I don't believe God exists.
He wasn't like that in the past.
It's the third of October.
This room is empty.
We're in the same class.
I want to come.
Tom shouldn't have told you.
We must do something to help.
He showed his heels to us.
I'm very happy for you.
He went there, never to return.
Tell them to do it now.
Something's happened, hasn't it?
Is there a telephone in the flat?
I wish I had more.
I'm really not very good at French.
I will go out if he comes here.
I didn't ask for any of this!
My father was never around.
There was no water in the river.
I am in this restaurant.
I can't see the end.
The question is whether he will agree with us.
I'll make popcorn.
I stayed with my uncle.
I stayed with my uncle.
I felt as if my face were on fire.
I put my shoes under the bed.
I got home and took my shoes off.
Go and see who it is.

They said he was the best writer in the group.
They said he was the best writer in the group.
They said he was the best writer in the group.
I was trying to get it right.
You're really weird.
I'm going to see her tomorrow.
My uncle lives in an apartment.
He is not the same as before.
It seems that Tony bought an expensive car.
When he comes, we'll begin.
I'm sort of an introvert.
That's not what I meant.
Today is Monday, so I'll do what I always do on Monday.
You've had all week to study.
He bought it for five dollars.
They are still living with their parents.
He and his wife had eight children.
She went that way.
They know your name.
They know your name.
If he knew, he would tell us.
Will you tell Tom?
I thought I told you you didn't need to be here.
I replied to you.
I replied to you.
How many windows are there in this class?
There were a lot of people on the street.
There were a lot of people on the street.
I wouldn't have made it without you.
We forgot them.
You want me to go, don't you?
You can't kill me.
You can't kill us both.
You look like a policeman.
You did it again.
Show me the way.
I feel it now.
Mount Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan.
I must send for the doctor.
I must send for the doctor.
In this room there are over 50 tables.
Now get out of my room.
Now get out of my room.
I'm going to live in Namibia.
Why was she laughing?
She's not my sister.
This book is mine. Where is yours?
The most important thing in life is to be yourself.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Not everyone likes that book.
The world is very complicated.
We have to think about our children.
This table is clean.
I guess I'll be going now.
Someone's eating.
Do you mean it?
Are you going to do it?
Where did you learn French?
Does Tom really need help?
Tom told me he didn't need my help.
She was blind, deaf, and mute.
Give us a break.
Give us a break.
Tom never talks about his exes.
No, that's not what I meant!
That's precisely what I meant.
Do you want me to come?
Do you want me to come?
Today is the best day of my life.
Who will you give the book to?
I'm a little out of practice.
That's my last word.
He's under the chair.
They'll do something.
Are you gonna help me or what?
I heard what Tom said to you.
I should've listened to what my mother said.
He is the boy of whom I spoke the other day.
He kept staring at me.
He went home three hours later.
He got a loan from the bank.
The house I bought is pretty far from downtown.
He may have already departed.
You must tell me the truth.
Didn't you notice that Tom was looking at you?
I couldn't figure out what he was talking about.
I couldn't figure out what he was talking about.
Tom doesn't know what to do now.
The name Edwin doesn't ring a bell.
That's not love.
Use your head.
You're always smiling.
You're always smiling.
Can you do it or not?
We seek happiness.
You should just leave.
You asked me to help.
Tom wanted to take a shower.
How many questions were on the test?
Please tell me when he'll be back.
Where were you when I really needed your help?
Tom is no longer a boy.
You're not allowed in this room.
Tom called me fat.
You may not remember me, but I remember you.
They were afraid of you.
They were afraid of you.
My brother is a boy and my sister is a girl.
Tom freaks me out.
Do you really want to help?
Do you really want to help?
Do you really want to help?
Do you really want to help?
Do you really want to help?
Tom wanted to know what had happened.
You just need practice.
You've got to stop them.
You've got to stop them.
Their job is to cook for the soldiers.
Some things just can't be explained.
I know what you did last night.
Who answered the phone?
You own a car, don't you?
There were only six people at the meeting.
He said he would recognize it when he saw it.
He said he would recognize it when he saw it.
I see with my eyes and hear with my ears.
I need money in general, not just now.
Where does your best friend live?
I'll get a cab.
My mother is two years younger than my father.
You don't want to talk to me, do you?
When did he die? "Not very long ago."
I am staying with my uncle in Tokyo.
We eat at home.
He is going to study English next week.
I'm aware of the possibility.
He speaks several languages.
He is not your friend or my friend.
There is a cat in this room.
I would like to buy a dog.

The doctor has saved my life.
Is Galileo Galilei a real name?
Are you alone right now?
Are you doctors?
Do you think they heard us?
Do you think Tom killed Mary?
Do you really want to do this?
I may be too old.
I was just about to go to bed.
Her father died when she was three.
He wrote the book.
Didn't you hear your name called?
We've been dating for three months now.
When he was young, he used to follow Beethoven everywhere he went.
I have never been there myself.
I wish I had a car.
I'd better go home.
Do you think that's enough?
Where did Tom go?
Don't do it, Tom.
Weather's pretty nice tonight.
They made love last night.
You may sit down.
The sky is getting dark.
Since when have you been waiting? Have you been waiting a long time?
I don't know what Tom thought.
I don't know what Tom thought.
I don't know where Tom has gone.
I don't know when Tom will come.
Do you know Brian? "Yes, I know him well." "Really? Since when do you know him?" "I've known him for six years."
They didn't do that.
Tom went to the city by bus.
You need to tell me what you want me to do.
This is a problem you have to solve by yourself.
This is a problem you have to solve by yourself.
We've really hit it off.
What do you want from life?
There was something else.
She is a girl.
You did not come to school yesterday.
He who has the money, also has the power.
Her mother is not as old as she looks.
You ought to write a book.
You ought to write a book.
Tom is lying in bed.
If you go, they'll go too.
I have two bad teeth.
Tom can do it in 10 minutes.
You don't have to eat it.
Tell me how it happened.
Ah, okay!
Tom is at home almost every evening.
Does he have his own house in Japan?
I'll have to tell Tom.
Thanks a lot for helping me today.
Tom isn't listening anymore.
This book is the smallest of all the books.
We have two sons.
Just stay the way you are.
What would Tom do if he ever learned the truth?
I told him what the problem was.
This is the best ink.
What else can I give you?
A book is on the table.
Some books are on the table.
What is a good life?
The company is hemorrhaging money.
It is already morning.
I will never forget your kindness so long as I live.
She allowed me to leave.
This is a personal decision for every person.
My friends live in the same house as me.
My father has a good job.
My friends live in the same house as me.
This jacket isn't expensive, it's very cheap.
I would like to live in Iceland.

I'm afraid he is ill.

Is his father a doctor?
I just remembered.
The whole world loves Brazil.
This is a woman who we can trust.
Does he have a big nose?
Are you two working together again?
How long have you two been working together?
I want to see them all.
You do not have to run fast.
I just want to go back.
Do the best you can.
Go that way.
Go that way.
I know you won't do it.
I know how they did it.
What did they bring me?
Do you know how I feel?
I want to be with them.
Do you want me to do that?
I play squash.
That's what I'm doing.
I tried to forget.
Put the money in your pocket.
Words cannot describe it.
I must go home.
I must go home.
Please write to me as soon as possible!
Please write to me as soon as possible!
What is the date today?
Their rooms are always clean.
Imagine yourself in her place.
Tom decided not to go to college.
What is he currently doing?
What is he doing now?
I didn't think that your wife was so old.
This is my Japanese friend.
You must leave now.
She came to Japan as a child.
My brother did that on behalf of me.
My brother did that on behalf of me.
My brother did that on behalf of me.
I stayed at home, for it rained that day.
It was simple.
You MAY do it.
You MAY do it.
I know who painted this picture.
If you take this medicine, you'll feel better.
If you take this medicine, you'll feel better.
It was a very long meeting.
What will become of his children after his death?
Is there enough room in the car for everybody?
I haven't seen you since high school.
You need to leave right now.
Let's go all together!
Tom can't have gone far.
I think that's what Tom was trying to tell me.
Everyone maintains their own truth.
You are in no state to drive.
You are in no state to drive.
I love your country.
You should go to work.
You should go to work.
It's an awful shame your wife couldn't come.
My sister doesn't work in Paris.
I'm not hurt.
I'm not leaving.
Tom told me why I should study French.
I'm no hero.
I'm no hero.
I'm sorry, but I have forgotten your name.
I'm so sorry, but I forgot your name.
That man said his name was Tom.
People used to laugh at him behind his back.
Tom likes people similar to himself.
That's exactly what I mean.
Your car's ready.
Your car's ready.
Your father is quite tall.
What are they going to do to me?
My brother is small but strong.
I will follow you until death, Georges!
The question is this.
Wait a minute… I think you should go with them.
You can't come with us.
I didn't have any problems.
I guess I'll be living with you a year from now.
I know Tom is a friend of yours, but I still don't like him.
Maybe they have something.
I have my own TV show.
Keep searching.
I want to know what happened to your car.
No one has the right to tell you that their life is harder than yours.
Tom said he didn't intend to stay.
Who was that girl?
I was here first.
Tom doesn't like my friends.
Tom doesn't like my friends.
The baby resembles his mother.
Yes, it can be done very easily.
Please don't do that again.
I was just taking a shower.
Let's find the others.
They have no more wine.
Take this medicine if you don't feel well.
Does your arm hurt?
Does Tom need help?
Perhaps I can help.
This is all I have.
It was a fair game.
It was a good game.
Go ask your father.
It's a good story.
This is a bad plan.
It was a good plan.
We should wait.
We have to help.
We should do it.
We just want you to tell the truth.
What do you think you'd do?
I like that one better.
Why did you do that? "I don't know."
Are you guys OK?
You'd better leave it.
I'll be back at 2:30.
Tom sent you, didn't he?
Listen, I have to go.
My town has two supermarkets.
This is holy ground.
That can't be! Seriously?
That can't be! Seriously?
I really don't have time for this.
Money doesn't buy happiness.
None of this was your fault.
I haven't eaten for three days.
We did everything together.
We shouldn't be together.
We shouldn't be together.
That shouldn't be a problem.
We have plans.
How many times have you done this?
How many times have you done this?
How many times have you done this?
We're not in love. We're just good friends.
Where have you been Tom? You're filthy! I told you not to play in the mud.
Where have you been Tom? You're filthy! I told you not to play in the mud.
Where have you been Tom? You're filthy!
You are laying in the bed.
Nevertheless, I want to go there.
Look what we've found.
Look what we've found.
Look what we've found.
Who knows what's going to happen?
That would be weird.
It happened that I saw my friend walking in the distance.
I forgot to tell them.
I forgot to tell them.
I forgot to tell them.
I forgot to tell them.
I forgot to tell her.
I forgot to tell him.
I forgot to tell him.
I knew Tom could do it.
I knew Tom could do it.
I'm going to go get some help.
I always wanted to be a father.
I always wanted to be a mother.
We've been together for 2 years.
You didn't mean it, did you?
My cat is sleeping on my bed.
My cat is sleeping on my bed.
I've had a good day so far.
I felt guilty and sad.
I was supposed to go to school.
May the Gods help us.
You should stop.
They often see us.
I am over forty.
I had to beg my friends to come.
She's a total bitch.
You don't have a wife, do you?
Tom got his way.
The lesson will start.
You had a long day.
Love others as you love yourself!
Let's sit at the same table.
Come to me.
Come to me.
Why aren't you sitting down?
You can sit down if you want.
You can sit down if you want.
There shouldn't be any problem.
You saw something, didn't you?
Tom is sitting on his desk.
Let's sit in the front row.
You're sitting in my chair.
You're sitting in my chair.
He heard the dog barking.
Stay here all night if you want.
You just need help.
You should stop that.
You're part of this.
I am your sun.
Don't blame yourself, Tom.
His aim in life was to become a great doctor.
Be careful where you step.
I know how some of you might feel about that.
A part of our own military has become involved with the enemy.
Control yourself.
Forget about the past, live the present, think about future.
I remember reading this book.
What a beautiful name!
I don't want to know all your old boyfriends' names.
We'll be back in an hour.
Tom is reading a newspaper.
Tom was here last night.
The old man wondered why life had passed him by.
Their answer is no.
The question is whether Tom will do it or not.
The question is whether Tom knew about it or not.
The question is whether Tom can do it or not.
Let me spell it out for you.
Tom is now studying.
Answer me right now.
Tom is at school right now.
Tom is writing a letter now.
Tom is working on it now.
Tom may not be at home now.
We need your help now.
Tom is a doctor now.
What do you think Tom is doing now?
Tom knows what to do now.
Beautiful, don't you think?
That boy doesn't eat.
He wrote me from Japan.
Tom is the last person I want to see right now.
I don't understand the rules of the game.
You got what you wanted.
We need a medic.
Turkey was stronger than Greece.
Miho is the girl I like best.
The adopted girl is from Panama.
I bought this book for less.
If I were free, I could help you.
They believe it.
They believe it.
It's a book for children.
It's a book for children.
I have about three minutes.
You left your lights on.
You are seeking a job, aren't you?
We've got to find it.
Thanks for your quick reply.
My mother's friends are my friends.
He took back what he had said about her.
This work is beyond me.
This work is beyond me.
Where was she at that moment?
Where was she at that moment?
What's the problem, Tom?
Tell me what you're going to do.
What else can they do?
Is that your goal?
Is this your money?
What kind of game are you playing, Tom?
What kind of game are you playing?
What kind of game are you playing?
What kind of game are you playing?
You were my best friend.
You were my best friend.
What's the problem, Tom?
That happened here.
It happened here.
We had a good time in the open air.
She contributed an article to the newspaper.
What did you tell your boss?
We must help him.
Everybody says I look like my father.
She has an uncle who works in a bank.
Tom wants to know Mary's past.
Mary is one of my favorite authors.
The bottle is almost full.
If anything happens to him, let me know.
This road leads to the station.
Only God can help you now.
Only God can help you now.
We only believe in those who believe in themselves.
Is that too much to ask for?
The house is clean.
I thought we had something to give to Tom.
He never fails to write to his mother every week.
If I knew anything, I'd tell you.
You're right, of course.
For me, they are the best.
Was it cloudy in Tokyo yesterday?
It is 100 years old.
I loved that car.
I heard someone shout outside the window.
There are several books on the desk.
Those are mine.
What is your plan?
I left.
I left.
I write to my mother once a month.
You're right in a sense.
What is he famous for?
Can I be there?
Tom chose to live with his father instead of his mother.
I need your help, Tom.
Tom doesn't know if he can do what you're asking him to do.
You shouldn't have paid the bill.
I would rather die than leave you, Tom!
You have to believe in something.
They'll try again.
I'm expecting a letter from her.
Dave never returned to school again.
He knows what you're thinking.
Did you go to London that day?
Do you have anything to declare?
The best time of life is when we are young.
I don't know any of the five ladies.
I don't know any of the five ladies.
My father will come home at seven.
He has been dead for ten years.
People should do their best.
I love love.
Ten years have passed since he went to America.
Get in line.
Get in line.
I shouldn't have asked you to do that.
Can I leave now?
I barely know you.
Mary was kneeling.
Don't ask me why.
I worked all this week.
He dropped it.
You should do the same.
You should do the same.
She wrote the word.
How was your test?
The president is difficult to approach.
Do you really believe this?
When I painted this picture, I was 23 years old.
Tom just wants to be loved.
He sat with his legs crossed.
He led a simple life.
You are afraid of death.
I feel your pain.
The child was paralyzed with fear.
The child was paralyzed with fear.
The child was paralyzed with fear.
You'll understand soon.
Tom doesn't have to work today.
That woman is strong.
Aren't you going to help?
My mother is beautiful.
I looked down at the sea.
I looked down at the sea.
Look! It's snowing.
Tom likes that one.
Every boy and girl knows him.
We had a very long talk.
We come from different countries.
Is it OK to drink alcoholic drinks in this park?
I love this picture.
It didn't taste good.
You must do what seems right to you.
It is 100 years old.
You really did it.
You really did it.
You can answer it.
You can answer it.
Tom doesn't know I'm alive.
I'm not going to school today.
What exactly do you do here?
She has no less than ten children.
I didn't see any reason to tell you.
If Tom told you he liked you, what would you do?
Where in Australia are you from?
I don't have the money to do that.
They didn't come here, did they?
I can't see where the problem is.
This watch was given me by my uncle.
We're not your enemy.
I guess you were right.
I guess you were right.
I guess you were right.
Am I supposed to be impressed?
They came to our aid at once.
He has a very good voice.
She has a very good voice.
You have a very good voice.
You have a very good voice.
Did you know that foxes live on this mountain?
He has lost his job.
There are a lot of places to see in Hokkaido.
The sky is over our heads.
He was sick, but he went to school.
Do you think such a thing is possible?
The pain is agonizing.
I'll never forget what happened that night.
We don't need you.
I don't like your name.
I don't like your name.
She has got a book.
Police shouldn't take bribes.
I slept lying on my face.
The paper is white; the snow is also white. The paper and the snow are white.
He is a total stranger to me.
He says he drinks to forget.
Your assistance is indispensable for us.
Your assistance is indispensable for us.
My wife is the boss at home.
I have a feeling you and I have a lot in common.
I have a few things I have to do before I can go home tonight.
You have to see it.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
I've had a lot of time to practice.
That guy is always asking his parents for money.
You know why I'm here, don't you?
I have to go and have an X-ray tomorrow.
He can't be an honest man.
Tom is just a friend. He's not my boyfriend.
George Bush is the forty-first president of the United States of America.
I've been to Hong Kong once.
Are you taking your meds?
I'm going to buy a few bottles of wine for dinner.
Tom is older than his wife.
Tom is standing near the window.
Tom isn't back from Australia yet.
I live here with my dog.
Tom was the only man in the room.
I'll kill them all.
Tom just wants to leave.
I can't talk about it now.
No one knows the reason.
No one can tell the reason.
I am a student of this school.
I feel at home in this room.
I want some answers and I want them now.
I don't want another job. I want this job.
I want my money back and I want it back now.
I want to see it for myself.
I want to see it for myself.
I want some of these books.
That wasn't me.
That wasn't me.
You must quit drinking.
Tom does everything we tell him to do.
Do you have any plans for tonight?
What're you going to do?
Don't tell my wife.
The past should be left in the past.
What kind of man was he?
That's exactly what I mean.
It rained hard last night.
We've had that before a thousand times.
We've had that before a thousand times.
There's something iffy about the situation.
He has a book.
He seems angry.
Who's sick?
Where does that road lead?
Do not be so critical.
All around the world, people were shocked.
What's your name? "Tatoeba." "Is that your real name?" "No."
You look like somebody I went to high school with.
Tom wanted to be tall.
It'll take months.
We came here to buy headphones.
Everytime I look at him, he smiles.
Words failed her.
I admit that I've already forgotten what I wanted to say.
The woman you were talking to at that time was my sister.
Here's the plan.
This could buy us some time.
I've got a visual on a hostile.
The bus was packed.
Gee whiz!
I was the cynosure of all eyes.
What can you see from your window?
Do you have a cell phone with you?
Please give me some paper I can write on.
A few minutes is all I ask.
I bumped my knee.
We can't leave now.
Tom might not know the answer.
Nancy was the first girl to come.
Something's wrong, isn't it?
It's empty.
Was there anybody in the room? "No, there was nobody there."
I had hardly started to work when it began to rain.
I can teach you my language.
My mother objected to my traveling alone.
Do you know where she's gone?
Show, don't tell.
I think we're all a bit crazy.
This machine is now out of date.
Tom never shouts.
I can't forget you.
Life? Don't tell me about life.
I'm going to go home now.
Why do I have to go?
How did you understand it was Tom?
The more she thought about it, the less she liked it.
I'm okay.
Tom is my son's best friend.
Seven has always been my favorite number.
Give the book to whomever wants it.
You asked about her? What did she say?
You don't need to be afraid.
That's too good to be true.
Life never stays the same.
What did I tell you about that?
You guys are the best.
Is Tom here? "No, he just left." "Really?"
We love you all.
Her English was better than mine.
I was in my apartment.
Where did you do time?
Where are my kids?
I will help you all I can.
I will help you all I can.
What's that boy's name?
What're you doing, Tom?
What we have is enough.
What was your response?
What was your response?
What was your question?
Tom is a nice guy.
What are those numbers?
We're on the same side.
Tom was home all night.
Tom wanted to be there.
Tom says he was hungry.
Didn't he go there?
Tom wasn't looking where he was going.
Tom wouldn't leave me alone.
Tom wouldn't leave me alone.
You can use my car.
Physician, heal thyself.
Macedonia and Bulgaria are not friends.
What are you going to do now?
He glanced at her name tag.
You need money to make money.
It's a great opportunity.
It's a great opportunity.
This will happen.
This will happen.
Make way, please.
This room is quiet.
Are you ready to go out?
Are you ready to go out?
He was looking at the sky.
There were neither flowers nor trees in the streets of his city.
Do you know them?
The girl resembled her mother.
Why didn't you tell us you knew how to speak French?
I haven't made a decision yet.
I haven't made a decision yet.
I haven't made a decision yet.
I haven't made a decision yet.
I want you to go to the doctor.
I want you to go to the doctor.
My heart was filled with happiness.
Tom is not a girl.
I was good.
A cop was killed.
A cop was killed.
I am 24 years old.
They called you.
They called you.
They called you.
I was always good at English.
Tell me what to do with it.
I've never been to Europe.
Tom was angry with himself.
A woman visited us while you were sleeping.
Tom asked me to help him.
I just didn't know what to do.
He asked me if I knew his father.
You look like a boy.
She looks like a boy.
You look like a boy.
He looks like a girl.
You look like a girl.
Thank you very much for your letter.
Please give me some water.
I want a boyfriend.
It was her first job.
It was his first job.
Nobody wants to do that.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
There's been a lot of rain this summer.
I want them alive.
Why are you asking about that?
Who gave you my number?
Who gave you my number?
Bring it to me.
We drank all night.
He didn't want to do it.
She didn't want to do it.
I was young and I needed the money.
Everybody does this.
Everybody does that.
I feel sleepy.
What've you written?
What've you written?
You must be back before ten.
You didn't understand.
Tom answered all the questions correctly.
Are we going to have to sleep here?
You are my three best friends.
You are my three best friends.
Stay out of the water.
I noticed that she was wearing new glasses.
I noticed that she's wearing new glasses.
People will laugh at you if you say so.
Tom started talking to himself.
My dog is white.
Let's do this first of all.
What about us?
What about us?
I want to hear this.
Tom decided to enter the room.
I'll help when I come back.
I'm not particularly impressed.
If that wasn't Tom, who was it?
Now my life will be better!
Please answer this question for me.
Who did you think it was?
I'd like to forget Marika.
Why does she no longer reply to me?
Do your parents know about this?
We both have the same problem.
I thought he had died.
Why don't you ask him yourself?
Why don't you ask him yourself?
Have you seen this man?
Have you seen this man?
You said you didn't understand.
You said you didn't understand.
I had to see you.
I had to see you.
I had to see you.
I had to see you.
What would I do without you?
Yes, it's possible
I really want to understand.
So where are you guys going?
Why don't you ask him yourself?
Why don't you ask him yourself?
I like your glasses.
Did you have something you wanted to say?
She looked at the picture.
Will he come this evening?
Tom tried to speak, but he couldn't.
This is exactly what I've been looking for.
You're afraid, aren't you?
You're afraid, aren't you?
I didn't want to do it this way.
I don't feel like walking so fast.
I wanted to see you tonight.
I'm doing this for them.
There were twenty or so people there.
He can't wait to see you.
He really needs your help.
Tom really needs your help.
She really needs your help.
I miss her a lot.
You want to buy a book.
You want to buy a book.
That doesn't even make sense.
Tom described what had happened.
Can you explain this?
Can you explain this?
Do you have a friend named Tom?
Do you have a friend named Tom?
How did you know where to find me?
How did you know where to find me?
No one else knows this.
I don't know how they did it.
I don't know how we did it.
Bite me!
I don't know what he's doing now, but it's not her.
She called you.
She called you.
Where is Tom? "I don't know. Maybe he's dead."
We don't do body counts.
Answer me when I'm talking to you!
We haven't started.
We heard voices.
We heard you.
We heard you.
We know enough.
We like games.
We must run.
We must speak.
Are you ready to do that?
He will go to Tokyo tomorrow, won't he?
We have the same problem.
This is my friend's letter.
I thought Tom had answered all your questions.
I don't know if he knows it.
Everyone's dead.
Let's just say no.
I expect him to come.
I will never see him.
Where is the station?
Everybody believes it.
Everybody believes it.
I don't see any blood.
They do it faster than me.
They do it faster than me.
The world is full of problems.
Someone tried to kill me.
When will he come?
I'd decided not to do that again.
The political systems of Britain and Japan have a great deal in common.
Tom left the room without saying a word.
She's at home taking care of the kids.
I think that's a good plan.
You can't do that.
You did say that.
You did say that.
Tom lives all alone in the woods.
I told him what to do.
I think Tom would tell the truth.
I thought I'd never hear that.
I'm not afraid anymore.
He is not the same as before.
I put my shoes under the bed.
Are you trying to kill me?
Show me what you have.
Show me what you have.
I'm not who you think I am.
I'm not who you think I am.
I'm not who you think I am.
I'm not who you think I am.
Who is that gentleman?
You aren't yourself.
You aren't yourself.
You aren't yourself.
You aren't yourself.
He went there instead of me.
So what is it you want me to do?
So what is it you want me to do?
Read as many books as possible.
I will leave when John comes.
I don't like this weather.
I no longer need them.
I don't need them anymore.
You know who I mean.
You know who I mean.
I haven't forgotten her.
Tom needs work.
He has no right to do this.
I can't find my shoes.
Did I do that?
What's Tom up to?
Tom said he'd be back soon.
Tom said it was none of my business.
Tom said he wasn't feeling well.
Tom said he would come, but he never showed up.
Tom said you wouldn't come.
Tom said you wouldn't come.
Tom said he'd see what could be done.
Tom said he'd see what he could do.
Tom didn't listen to what I said.
We can always know how to.
Tom said you'd know what to do.
Tom would've never done this.
Remember what happened last time.
Remember what happened last time.
I miss you very much.
Why did he do that?
Why did he do that?
Put the book back on the shelf.
He's crazy about me.
Today, I have other plans.
Why don't you ask her yourself?
Why don't you ask her yourself?
Why don't you ask her yourself?
Why don't you ask her yourself?
Why don't you ask her yourself?
Why don't you ask him yourself?
Tom never would've said that.
Your name isn't Tom, is it?
Why did this happen to me?
Come and see this.
Come and see this.
Tom asked about you.
Watch the road.
Watch the road.
How on earth did you know that?
I'm more famous.
I'm more famous.
What does he want to do?
Tell me when to stop.
Tom's hardly got a good word to say about his brother.
I've been doing this longer than you.
Tom reads the paper every morning.
She doesn't speak my language.
You have a kid, don't you?
I'm scared to talk to her.
I have a lot of flowers. Some are red and others are yellow.
Tom might not want to see Mary.
Tom received a letter from Mary.
Has Tom been there?
No woman had ever done this before.
She has a cat. The cat is white.
I'll stay here and help Tom.
I'll tell Tom you were here.
I'll tell you what happened.
I'll tell you what happened.
I opened one eye.
He didn't give me his real name.
I needed just that.
That was the last time I saw him.
That was the last time I saw her.
Tom didn't appear during the meal.
He played with his cat.
That's not quite right.
This can't be right.
That can't be true.
I'll decide that later.
What did you want to show us?
What did you want to show us?
My wife was there.
I can't do this by myself.
I can't do two things at once.
I can't even think about it.
I can't even think about it.
That is mine. I don't know where yours is.
That is mine. I don't know where yours is.
That is mine. I don't know where yours is.
That is mine. I don't know where his is.
That is mine. I don't know where his is.
That is mine. I don't know where hers is.
That is mine. I don't know where hers is.
That is mine. I don't know where yours is.
That is mine. I don't know where yours is.
That's all we can do for now.
Tom would never do such a thing.
They asked me to leave.
I know where Tom went.
I know where Tom went.
I know where Tom was going.
I know where Tom went.
I know where Tom will go next.
I know where Tom will go next.
I know where you were yesterday evening.
I know where you're going.
I know where you're going.
I know which way Tom went.
I pretended I didn't know who Tom was.
She said that he was handsome.
She said that he was handsome.
I know who we're dealing with.
I know who you are, and I know why you're here.
I know who you are, and I know why you're here.
I know who your father is.
No other mountain in the world is so high as Mt. Everest.
I know why we're doing this.
I know why you did it.
I know why you did it.
I know why you didn't tell the truth.
I know why you didn't tell the truth.
I would do it in a different way than you did.
I would do it in a different way than you did.

The bus will be here in five minutes.
My nose is too big.
It's the same every time.
Buy or die!

He helped the lady into the car.
I'm on my way home.
We are all in the same situation.
Eat, while it's still hot.
Let's eat before our dinner gets cold.
No one has that right.
Who should go first?
Tom was reluctant to talk about it.
Take one of these.
Take one of these.

What time is it, anyway?
It has to be true.
Just then, the bus stopped.
How can I get to heaven?
I cannot possibly help you.
Well, see you later.
I didn't know where to get the bus.
I was moved.
Tom will go there tomorrow.
I'd like to go to Hawaii.
Who wrote Hamlet?
Will you have some more pie?
Anywhere with a bed will do.
Mayuko was alone in the room.
Mike smiled.
I belong to the karate club.
Meg was the only girl that was wearing jeans.
Are there enough chairs to go around?
I'll explain the matter to you later on.
We'd like another bottle of wine.
We'd like to have some wine.
They're going to die.
I've never heard such a thing.
She likes her job.
We like our job.
They like their job.
The last time that happened I didn't know what to do.
I don't know whether I'll go or not.
You're the only guy here I know.
Show me what you have hidden behind your back.
The boy talking with Fred is Mike.
We're looking for a place to stay.
We're a lot alike.
Would Tom do it?
Tom raised his arms.
Tom saw a doctor.
Tom went for a doctor.
Are you ready to go home?
It seems that Tom is sick.
You'll learn a lot here.
Tom works about 30 hours a week.
Everyone knows how to write his or her own name.
I don't want to talk about school.
He had been walking for hours.
When did you get up?
The station is to the west of the hotel.
It may sound strange, but it is true.
I can imagine how you felt.
The sky grew darker and darker, and the wind blew harder and harder.
I'd like to go to the seaside with you.
He told me he would go to Venice.
You may laugh at me.
You worked a lot this week.
I think you're both right.
I think both of them are right.
He's always at home on Sundays.
I'm going to take three days off next week.
Men should work.
Tom was a bad person.
Tom was already here.
Tom was at the hotel.
Tom was in the house.
There's only one bottle of red wine left.
You're the person I've been looking for.
We'll be there in less than three hours.
We've known each other for three years.
Tom is three years older than his wife.
What's the longest river in the world?
We have less than three minutes left.
Tom got up and walked out of the bar.
It's been three years since Tom died.
There's something wrong with my car.
I'm staying for another three weeks.
I wanted to ask you about something.
I wanted to ask you about something.
We have less than three hours left.
Tom was here less than an hour ago.
That's the book I bought yesterday.
It's a pity that Tom died so young.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
Do you have something else in mind?
Tom says we can start without him.
Tom said more than he should have.
You should've started without me.
You should've started without me.
Tom wanted both of them to leave.
It's time you told Tom the truth.
It's time you told Tom the truth.
This is your destiny.
It's a pity that Tom can't come.
I'm not well today.
You're the tallest person here.
You're better than all of them.
You're better than all of them.
They seem to know all about us.
There's always something to do.
We'll be there in three hours.
We need at least another hour.
You're a really bad listener.
One of us has to go.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I'll do it as soon as I can.
There's a call for you.
We both know what happened.
Tom really needs your help.
You're a really bad cook.
Tom really wants to help.
They're not coming today.
You're on the wrong bus.
You're on the wrong bus.
Tom, is that really you?
Tom was crazy about you.
I don't want to study German.
Are you really a doctor?
You'll help, won't you?
We'll be together soon.
Tom was here all day.
We'll accept your conditions.
This one is for us.
Tell Tom that I'm fine.
Tell Tom that I'm fine.
Don't take it personally.
The room has been empty for a long time.
It's not my decision.
It's not so cold today.
I'll explain it to Tom.
It's not so hot today.
I'll be here tomorrow.
Tom is a strange kid.
I'll tell you the truth.
I'll tell you the truth.
You're a true hero.
You need a friend.
What is Tom eating?
Please, don't do it.
What did you eat when you were in Australia?
I didn't see you until now.
Armenia is called "Hayastan" in Armenian.
People often said this to my mother.
I don't want to know what his name is.
I need you.
Tom asked for some water.
Tom lay on the ground.
It is pretty cold.
Tom said that somebody here needed help.
What is the age of the oldest?
What is the age of the oldest?
I was afraid you'd say that.
I was afraid you'd say that.
I want to be with my family.
I understand what you meant.
I understand what you meant.
Eat it!
Eat!
I will write to you soon.
If you're not going I'm not going either.
If you're not going I'm not going either.
Is your sister here?
I told you Tom didn't do it.
What is going on with Tatoeba lately?
Does he have long hair?
How is that possible?
Her brother looked at her.
Are you now working part-time or full-time?
This story is true.
Newspapers lay scattered all over the floor.
Tom will pass.
It's all happening again.
This means war!
They are not my friends.
It won't be enough.
Please don't be afraid.
Please don't be afraid.
We're not ready to go yet.
Don't let them forget me.
Tell me you'll do it.
Tell me who did this.
Tell me what you did.
Tell me how to do it.
I told Tom about you.
Did Tom tell someone?
Tom would never do that!
I never would've done that.
She was injured in the traffic accident.
You should have told me.
I'll tell my dad!
I'll do anything but that.
I'll do what I can to help.
I'm going to become the best.
Tom doesn't want me to go, but I'm going to go anyway.
She informed me of her decision.
English is not spoken here.
Tell me how to solve the problem.
It is the highest mountain in the world.
My house is in a village.
You play games too much.
Whether you like it or not, either I bake the cake or no one will!
I must say I'm flattered.
Tell Tom everything I told you.
What do you know about it?
Come tomorrow.
Come alone.
Does Tom know what's happening?
What exactly did you do?
What exactly did you do?
What exactly did you do?
We're both in the same class.
Why did you have to go?
We didn't know what to do.
It appears to me that we misunderstand him.
Tom should be in school.
Tom said you'd be able to help me.
Help me to understand.
I'll go to Kyoto.
It may well snow tomorrow night.
There's a telephone in my room.
There is no chair in this room.
Please get out.
These windows aren't clean.
We have to be at work by nine.
That's going to cause some problems.
What would you like to buy? "I would like to buy a dog."
My wife still hasn't met my parents.
Did you think about it?
That child's mother is a director.
My wife still hasn't met my parents.
My uncle lives in New York City.
I'm sitting on a chair.
I don't think anyone has lived in this house for years.
We like to play.
Like I care!
Like I care!
I am reading a book on US history.
I am reading a book on the history of the Americas.
Tom is my only real friend.
You don't have to respond.
You don't have to respond.
Do you like this city?
Don't go too far away.
She's a doctor.
Everyone likes them.
I consider him a friend.
Tom asked me for some money.
Are you planning to stay?
That car is mine.
Does he need the book?
Does she need the book?
Do you need the book?
Show me where it happened.
Show me where it happened.
Show me where it happened.
Show me where it happened.
All we can do now is wait and see what Tom does.
I think I know you.
I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you.
I want to believe you.
Could you please tell Tom we need his help?
Did you really do that?
I don't believe that he's telling the truth.
They came last week.
Did you already do that?
Don't forget to answer the letter.
My book is here.
Give me your arm.
Give that to me, please.
Which one of you was here first?
I didn't forget it.
You're entitled to the truth.
He must come.
Your mother loves me.
What did you do at night?
Does it have to be today?
Do you have to stay?
Is it okay if I use your car today?
I wonder if you'd help us.
I just got home.
I can't say that to my dad.
I think we need a doctor.
I think we should go now.
I think we'd better leave.
Tell Tom that I already know how to do that.
You have a telephone.
Why can't you do it?
Why can't you do it?
Do you really not know?
Do you really not know?
How long have you known about it?
How long have you known about it?
I think Tom has been here already.
I think Tom is going to die.
I'm not the only one with a child.
I've always been here.
You've forgotten me, haven't you?
I never do that.
He can do it.
I really wish I could be there with you.
I know you've been trying to help.
Here's my room.
I left one of my books at school.
I left one of my books at school.
I like to be here.
I have just a few questions.
I can't remember all their names.
Where's the book I need?
There are a lot of people here today.
I know about that already.
These boxes are heavy.
I want to go to school.
I've heard of you.
Is it always cold like this?
I just figured out who you are.
I figured it out by myself.
I got what I asked for.
I guess that's how I'd do it.
I had a problem with my car.
I had a really good time yesterday.
I had to accept it.
I do that a lot.
I do that all the time.
I don't know if I'll be able to help you on Monday.
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
I don't know what the truth is.
I think you haven't understood the question.
I always do that.
They were in that room with me all night.
Did you recognize any of those people?
Did you recognize any of those people?
I think we should go there.
I've always been here.
Do you need the phone?
Do you need the phone?
How long were you gone?
How long were you gone?
How long were you gone?
How long were you gone?
How long were you gone?
How long were you gone?
How long were you gone?
How long were you gone?
We should all go to bed.
We should be friends.
We should be home soon.
We should be there.
That's idle talk.
We should be together.
I should probably not have done that.
We should both go.
Maybe I should go.
Go right ahead.
Go right ahead.
You can open your eyes now.
You can open your eyes now.
I don't think I can do this without him.
I don't think I can do this without her.
I can't trust anyone.
You can put it there.
You can put it there.
You can put it there.
You can put it there.
You may leave us, Tom.
You shouldn't try to do that by yourself.
You shouldn't try to do that by yourself.
You shouldn't try to do that by yourself.
I'm all ears.
Here, look at this.
Here, look at this.
I think this book is easy.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
Toss your gun over here.
I'll scream.
I knew who my enemies were.
One of us has to do this.
You don't know my brother.
I don't really understand.
We're going to go.
You should leave.
Is Tom still playing?
If you want to, we'll go.
I really want to know her name.
I have to leave.
I must've forgotten.
Why do you keep giving him money?
I didn't tell him everything.
I want mine.
Come to us.
Everyone's eating.
Everyone should go.
I heard that.
I don't know what to believe.
Don't be afraid to talk to him.
I replied that I didn't have parents any more.
You didn't come here alone, did you?
Why don't you stay there?
Why don't you tell me what you remember?
I really like that guy.
I have seen enough.
I forgot the book at home.
How many people are likely to show up?
Who'll come?
I didn't understand it yet.
I can't accept this.
I can't accept this.
Have you done this before?
I killed her.
I killed him.
Let's sit down here.
What would you do without me?
She is a really good girl.
He almost died.
Do you want to do this now?
Do you want to see my cat?
Nobody has made a decision yet.
I will think of something.
I'm going to show you something.
I couldn't stand any more.
Have you made up your mind yet?
He's the one who told me about that.
He's the one who helped me.
Tom is writing something.
It's about time you went to school.
I don't want to think about what could have happened.
I want you to tell me everything that happened.
I don't have all day.
He can stay here for one night, no longer.
I want to know what I can do right now.
If you don't want to do this, you don't have to.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
I was the only woman.
It's because he loves me.
It's because I love you.
I really don't want to live here.
I thought you might want to know.
I want you to take this with you.
Well, what do you want me to say?
That's not something I want to do.
Do you want to stay here all night?
I don't know if we want to do that.
I want to be in your life again.
Is that what you want me to say?
That'd be good.
What else do you want me to say?
Do you want me to tell the truth?
I just don't want you to have it.
I want you to help me die.
I'd like to go to my room.
I want to be there, you know.
Tom can't just do whatever he wants.
I do want to see you.
I want you to come back.
He made up his mind.
Let's do that.
I like it when you do that.
Does he know how she feels about him?
Do you want to do this or not?
He wasn't there last week.
I believe love exists.
I need this money.
Would you like that?
I'm asking you as a friend.
You must come.
I thought I saw something.
I thought I heard you.
I thought we weren't going to do this.
I thought we weren't going to go there.
I thought you wanted the truth.
Watch how I do it.
I can't stay.
He and only he knows the whole truth.
I thought I heard something.
I can't do that now.
I can't do this job without you.
You can't have this.
You can't help Tom tomorrow because you have to work all day.
I can't help you unless you tell me the truth.
I can't believe I didn't think of it.
I can't believe I'm really here.
I can't believe you've never heard of us.
You can't come tomorrow.
We can't do it now.
I can't do it today.
I can't do that anymore.
I could hear everything.
I saw him first.
I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't come to help me.
I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't come to help me.
I ran into a tree.
You've done so much for me.
You've done so much for me.
Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.
You must do as I say.
Do you want to see more?
Would you like to see it?
I have to go to work now.
I know what you're doing.
I really want to see you.
You're a man now.
I must do that.
What do we do now?
How many did you get?
How are you going to do that?
Have you been here all day?
Do you believe me now?
Did I write that?
Can I get you anything?
He did not want her to leave.
How many did you take?
We have a problem. "What sort of problem?"
Don't respond to that.
Come back here.
I'll never do that again.
How did his son die?
Answer my question.
Answer my question.
Just do your job.
My son won't listen to me.
I can't do it right now.
Aren't those your parents?
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
I didn't tell anyone what time I'd be arriving.
Tell me what to do here.
He lives in his car.
Stand by me.
You're not listening to me.
We have to wait often.
You should have told him.
I don't like it when he does that.
That man loves my sister.
That man loves my sister.
I'll never forget it.
Who wants to go first?
You can make your own.
He can do better.
I did the best I could do.
There are things that women will never understand...
Why do you want to do this?
I am hers and she is mine.
We're working at the moment.
These books are all mine.
I would like to go and get my stuff.
You know I have to go.
The two brothers are still alive.
This shouldn't happen.
This is not good at all.
What car did he take?
What car did he take?
How can this be done?
Men are better at this than women.
Tom is the man of the house.
Where's the girl?
Don't think about it too much.
I'm not the only one who feels that way.
I don't belong here.
Tom is playing with his son.
Tom is playing with his son.
Yes, we can go.
Yes, we can go.
Yes, it's true!
I've always believed in you.
I figured that might be the case.
I thought that was the case.
Tom is your son, isn't he?
Look out your window.
No one believes her.
No one believes him.
No one understood.
You have the right to know.
You have the right to know.
Tom isn't going to know.
Tom is the only one who doesn't know.
Who else do you want to visit?
Do you hear voices?
Do you hear voices?
What's behind the wall?
You can take as much as you want.
You can take as much as you want.
You may leave if you want to.
You may leave if you want to.
Did Tom ask about us?
Did Tom ask about us?
They tried to kill us.
Tom isn't like us.
Tom didn't recognize any of us.
Tom is respected by all of us.
Please come with us.
Tom wanted to come with us.
The sun just came up.
Hi Tom, what's up?
I'd kill for a beer right now.
All we can do now is wait.
Tom bad-mouthed Mary to all his friends and family after their breakup.
Tom lived alone with his dog.
She's forgotten how to do it.
She can't do that.
Where's Tom when you need him?
She knows the truth.
He does it fast.
You're not the only one who feels that way.
Do you really want to know what happened?
He could die.
She could die.
All the other kids do it.
I'd rather be at home.
He knows what he's doing.
This is how it has always been.
They all did it.
I can't believe you would do that to me.
Maybe she can tell you more.
They didn't know what to do with him.
Can it really be this bad?
Tom worked all night.
He didn't want to leave.
I don't understand a word of what he says.
He's asking you to help him.
I should've known better.
I don't want to quit this job.
You have to believe in yourself.
He lived there completely alone.
This is mine, and this is yours.
I can't tell you what to do.
While we're waiting, why don't you tell me what happened?
I want my own room.
I looked for my room.
What was she like?
I don't understand what she wants me to do.
Is this where your mother works?
Is this the place where your mother works?
If you think you're someone, you stop becoming someone.
Nobody showed up today.
He knows all the answers.
You should help your father.
Shouldn't we go now?
I wish that he was here to help us.
I just want you to be OK.
I just wanted to see you.
If you want to come with us, come with us.
Where is my dog?
Do you know my name?
I would've told you before, but I didn't think you'd understand.
The last one is the best.
She arrived when we were about to leave.
Please don't forget to write the letter.
Everyone wants me to go, but I don't feel like going.
What should I do? I said to myself.
He never listens to what I am trying to say.
I wrote her a letter every day.
I'd like to have a cat.
We did not help him, so he made it by himself.
I never spend a day without thinking of you.
What is the doctor doing?
I love her so much I could die.
He's been waiting here for quite a while.
I haven't eaten for two days.
Please don't write to me again.
The boy and the man are drinking water.
What is the man doing?
I only have eyes for you.
Their work seems good to me.
Tom shouldn't have done what he did.
What is the most beautiful thing in the world?
Mine is not as good as yours.
Am I the only one that feels this way?
They're afraid of us.
He left here two or three days ago.
I was the only one who didn't know.
I was the only one who didn't know.
She's the only one who doesn't know.
He's the only one who doesn't know.
Tom didn't have any friends here.
A doctor was called in right away.
Is it a girl or a boy?
Let's not tell anybody until next Monday.
The school is keeping me occupied.
Have you taken your medicine?
Tom needs money.
Do I owe you money?
Even though I wanted to help Tom, I wasn't able to.
Did we solve the problem?
Have you called the police?
Did you call the police?
Did you call the police?
Tom did it once.
Do you feel OK?
Do it right now.
Tom can walk.
OK, I think I got it.
You'll stay here tonight.
Tom was ready.
They have enough money.
Tom responded quickly.
This is your destiny.
Why did Tom decide to quit his job?
It's a very long story.
It's a very long story.
I don't think it's going to rain today.
Wow, that was fast!
He brought me coffee.
I don't want to work today.
When we saw what was happening there, we decided to leave.
What kind of person do you think I am?
This is the book I want to buy.
May I ask you to help me with something?
I thought I'd prefer going by myself.
I really wanted to go.
Is there a letter for me?
I love him more than any other boy.
The dog is still alive.
I don't want to give you my money.
What kind of book do you want?
Would you be willing to show me how to do that?
I might be able to help.
I'll never leave you alone again.
He's your son.
She almost never does what she says she's going to do.
He did what they told him.
Is there a woman in your life?
Is there a man in your life?
We'll begin shortly.
I think I've forgotten something.
Tom quit school.
Tom didn't understand the question.
I think we still have plenty of time.
If you tell people what they want to hear, they'll do what you want.
Why did you decide to buy this house?
Tom doesn't think he could do that.
Tom doesn't think anybody else wants to come.
Tom doesn't remember what happened.
Tom doesn't need any money now.
Tom doesn't like my dog.
Tom doesn't know who he should ask.
She writes to her son from time to time.
You don't have to do what Tom says.
Tom is trying to learn French.
You're the one I've been waiting for.
You're the one I've been waiting for.
You're the only person I know besides me who likes to do that.
You're the only person I know who can help me.
If God is with us, then who is against us?
Take it, please.
I'll do what you ask.
I can't tell you how to do that.
Is she gone?
Tom is at work.
I think it's time for me to say what I really think.
I think it's time for me to study.
She told him to study.
She was the first one to help him.
She wrote to him to tell him that she loved him.
Tom is here again.
Tom is behind you.
Tom is behind you.
Tom is back there.
Tom is in his car.
She gives him everything he asks for.
She got the money from him.
Tom is at his desk.
She herself helped him because no one else would.
She herself helped him.
She told him that she was leaving.
Who was not here?
Tom is in his room.
What books have you read in English?
People should love one another.
Tom is in his seat.
I heard you.
She asked me what had become of him, but I didn't know.
She asked me what had become of him.
Tom is in my class.
Tom is in my class.
Tom is back in town.
Tom is in the hallway.
Tom is here every day.
You have to tell us.
The phone is on the table.
Tom wants me to stay.
Tom wants me to stay.
Tom likes to play with my dog.
I have a boyfriend who loves me.
How many words should you write?
You will exist but you will never know what it is to live.
I am not studying.
Please show me how I have to do it.
Ask me anything you like.
They could only listen.
He went to school only for a few years.
Your brother will not buy it.
Please tell me about it.
My mother feels better.
That will happen later.
Why should you do that?
You can come at any time.
He knows this city very well.
She's only going to tell you what she thinks you want to hear.
Everyone must die.
Could you assist me, please?
We don't know why he had to leave.
I would prefer today over tomorrow.
That's all she wrote.
I'm undecided as of yet.
Haven't you said too much?
I don't know how to go there.
How long ago did you start learning Esperanto?
I do anything I feel like.
We still can’t see it.
That house is really better than this house.
If so, then there's no problem at all, is there?
What on earth is it?
You shouldn't have gone there.
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't do that.
We must do more than yesterday.
These are my books and those are his books.
Tom picked up the water bottle and took a drink.
Upon seeing what was happening, we decided to leave.
I've only got one left.
He was the first to help him.
He was the first to help her.
Please come see me tomorrow.
I will show you some.
By the time you came back, I'd already left.
I came only for you.
Why didn't you say so earlier?
I must go to Istanbul.
I don't know if I have enough money.
I forgot my money.
My English is not good at all.
He can do it better than I can.
The woman is reading.
The problem is what we should do with this money.
Even a child knows what it is like to be without friends.
Nobody believes what I say.
Is the room big enough for you?
Could you come and see me tomorrow?
He said that he would come back here tomorrow.
I would rather go today than tomorrow.
She left her son alone in the car.
She stayed here by herself.
She may not come here tomorrow.
She is too young to go to school.
She hasn't come here yet.
She's at work, isn't she?
She asked me how many languages I spoke.
She asked me to help her with the work.
I don't particularly like her.
She should help her mother.
She may have said so.
She listened to him.
She has nothing to do with the matter.
She has some money of her own.
The moment she was alone, she opened the letter.
She, of all people, wouldn't do such a thing.
She told me she knew my brother.
I have a feeling I know where Tom is.
I would rather die than do such a thing.
Tom won't go.
This letter's for me.
What do you do on Fridays?
My sister resembles my mother.
Do you have anything to tell me?
Tom had never seen any of them before.
Good, but you can do better.
What was she doing when you saw her?
Better a new friend than an old foe.
The man is driving a car.
I work on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.
How does Tom know about that?
Tom wants me to go with him.
Tom wants me to see everything.
Tom wants me to leave, but I won't.
As you can see, we're still working.
All my friends and family are dead.
They came here one after another.
They asked after my father.
I have known her since she was a little girl.
My house is like yours.
They may not know about it.
How can they do this?
It seems that he knows the truth.
He made it.
He came just as I was leaving.
He asked me who that man was.
He took me by the hand.
He had been writing a letter.
He wants to be a doctor in the future.
Why did he ask for so much money?
Did he study English yesterday?
He is not the boy who came here yesterday.
He has a few friends in this town.
He may have said so.
He was reading a book at that time.
He asked the man to help him.
I didn't need to tell him.
He said, "I want to be a doctor."
He may be able to come tomorrow.
I believe that he comes here.
Do you want him?
Let him do it alone.
It may be that he likes his job.
Who is in this room?
Nobody came to help him.
You should always think before you speak.
Why do you take so long to eat?
All men must die.
Tom often dreams of his girlfriend.
What was it supposed to mean?
We're not afraid.
They call us Russians.
Where's Minsk?
We couldn't go there because we didn't have a car.
It was time to leave.
I think he has done it.
I remember seeing him once.
I went to school yesterday.
I am going to write a letter.
I have not seen you for ages.
I have never been to that town.
I don't know what has become of the boy.
I answered neither of the letters.
I was about to leave my house.
My father may be sleeping.
I asked him if he knew my name.
He is not any taller than I am.
Please tell me what you know about it.
I'll stay here if you really want me to.
If you don't believe me, go and see for yourself.
My father was still at home when I left.
I'll get there before you will.
It seems to me that we should go now.
You'd better not go today.
It's me that went there yesterday.
I fear so.
I wish I didn't have to work.
Even children can understand it.
One of the children is studying, but the others are playing.
I can't see you without thinking of your mother.
All you have to do is believe me.
I wish I could go with you today.
I will go if you come.
If I had known that you were here, I would have come at once.
One of the fellows you were with is a friend of mine.
What will you be doing at this time tomorrow?
I will write to you as soon as I can.
Were you with anyone?
You ought not to go out.
You were mine.
You were mine.
You may as well come with me.
You don't have to work today.
What must you do now?
This is the end of the world as we know it.
This is the end. Go away!
I've heard a lot about you.
It seems to be a good house.
That man is in love with my sister.
I have often been here.
Here are some letters for you.
I know you can make it.
Let's keep this matter between ourselves.
I would like this book.
There are more girls than boys in this school.
This is the biggest car in the world.
This is a very small book.
This is all he has to do.
This is mine, and that's yours.
You had better go at once.
You don't have to tell that to your parents.
How often have you been there?
I've been to neither of those places.
It was a very big room.
You should've said so earlier.
The room is too small to play in.
The man took the boy by the hand.
You have given me so many.
How can I quit this job?
What kind of places would you like to see?
It seems that no one knows the truth.
Tom is coming to our school tomorrow.
Does Tom have to write the letter today?
Take the one you like best, whichever it is.
Everyone went there, didn't they?
If anything should happen, please let me know.
I don't feel like waiting any longer.
Please take another one.
It's about time to go to school.
Come with me, will you?
You don't say.
What are you going to see?
You can't go out.
I feel like going out.
Do you know what you're asking?
Either you or I have to go there.
You tried.
He's not working much at the moment.
Did you read it at all?
You could have done it.
What time did he say he'd come?
What time did he say he'd come?
I'm not going to do that anymore.
She was a little girl then.
Mali is one of the poorest countries in Subsaharan Africa.
You have only to give him a little help.
Is everybody all right?
She was about to leave.
I've decided to go.
It's been ten years since I came to Tokyo.
It's 8:00 p.m.
Mt. Fuji is very beautiful.
Are you guys from Austria, or is it Australia?
We are at war.
Mr. White and I aren't friends. We're just acquaintances.
When I was a child, our house seemed bigger than now.
I'm the law.
What has happened?
They're alive.
Keep looking.
I was impressed with her work.
I used to go to school when I was a child.
I used to go to school when I was a child.
Maybe next time!
We're just trying to help you.
I have never been to Florida.
We've talked about it.
It's easier than it looks.
I didn't tell her everything.
He never saw his parents again.
I can't find my ticket.

She did a good job.
When did World War II break out?
Tom wanted to be like his father.

Tom wanted to leave, but he couldn't.
I've had enough of this.
I would like to live in Brazil.
Tom is big and strong.
You're leaving already?
You're leaving already?
He left a minute ago.
I am not a member of the club.
I believe this is the only thing I can do for you.
Where's the director?
It was really cold on Tuesday.
I was about to suggest the same thing.
She is over twenty.
The real heroes are us.
There was no cat.
I've thought a lot about this.
I only have ten books.
He has a common name.
Be nicer to your brother.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I've looked everywhere.
This is infuriating.
There was a strong wind on that day.
My parents don't know.
He died doing what he loved.
They come from the same country.
They come from the same country.
You need to stop.
Tom is going to be here.
We've all done it.
Tom is thinking about it.
This meal would be enough for three.
It happened once.
It happened once.
I really don't feel like talking.
Life is good.
Tom often reads in bed.
Such gods have never existed.
I will not forget you.
I will not forget you.
Don't act like you don't know what's happening.
I don't know what else to do.
Our school is in this village.
What was his name?
Tom didn't know their names.
It's easier to die than to love.
I just want to hold her hand.
Who should I inform?
I think Tom really likes you.
You should have spoken more politely.
Your wristwatch is on the table.
I'll take back everything I said.
You have a beautiful name.
I admit it. I was wrong.
Would you like to have another beer?
I never drink.
Isn't that what we were supposed to do?
Our school is further away than the station.
He took a shortcut through the forest.
This young man knows little about his country.
If you could come, I'd be really happy.
If you could come, I'd be really happy.
The wind has abated.
You have to stay here.
You have to stay here.
Are you going to tell us what happened?
Tom doesn't think it's true.
It's difficult, isn't it?
1989 was a difficult year.
Do you know the family?
Tom can give you an answer tomorrow.
Tom can give you an answer tomorrow.
Is it your fault or ours?
How can I solve this problem?
You'd better not tell Tom.
Where is the logic in that?
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
You shouldn't have told him such a thing.
Her new husband turned out to be a bad person.
I don't like telling you the truth.
I don't like telling him the truth.
Is it near your house?
Tom doesn't always play by the rules.
I've forgotten my pin number.
I've forgotten my pin number.
I can bake bread.
Take your medicine.
He had two sons, who became doctors.
Either Tom doesn't want to do it or he can't.
There was no cat.
There weren't any cats.
Have you decided to go to Australia?
Your hands are so cold.
The sun will set soon.
Please come into my home.
Please come to my house.
Please come to my house.
Please come to my house.
In some countries, being a woman is not a good thing.
Because of my job, I will be in Tokyo next week.
Where have you seen these women?
I see I was wrong.
Where did you see those women?
Do you know what's going on?
No matter what he may say, don't trust him.
No matter what anyone says, I plan to go.
I have no way of knowing that.
Tom is afraid of my dog.
My foot is small beside yours.
I should've said that.
I should've said that.
What's your biggest fear?
How old is your car?
Can you show me where the bathroom is?

Why can't we do that?
Why can't I do that?
It is possible.
They want to go home.
Tom was on the same bus with me.
He crossed the Rio Grande River.
What have you heard?
What have you heard?
It snowed all last night.
They stepped a few paces forward.
Don't believe Tom.
Don't believe Tom.
He's running very quickly.
Did Tom eat?
Was Tom here?
I more often go to Brussels than Paris.
That's him at the window.
This gives me the strength to go on.
You don't give up too easily, do you?
My living room has wide windows.
Tom couldn't find his way back home.
Tom is probably still at home.
We must get away.
He gave them food and money.
Your car is fast, but mine is faster.
I don't know if you remember me.
I don't know if you remember me.
How would you do that?
How would you do it?
The question is how.
He asked for my help.
He asked me to help.
You need me, Tom.
We looked down at the beautiful sea.
Am I ready to die?
Am I ready to die?
Tom already knows what happened.
No one wants to answer that question.
I left the window open.
Gangway!
I should not have said that.
They may pass.
Who fired first?
Bring me some water.
Is the snake alive?
What do you see in the picture?
She seems to be excited.
My book has to be somewhere in the room.

Machines may one day think, but they'll never laugh.
Please find a solution to the problem.

What's your first name?
You better buy that book.
I should not have said that.
Would you please explain the rules to me?
I have eaten a lot this week.
Why don't we take him a bottle of wine?
No one else could do my work.

Tom knows how to cook.
Tom is writing a book.
His name was becoming widely known.
Tom called the police.
They're working on it.
They know what we did.
The pain will go away.
It wasn't you, was it?
It wasn't you, was it?
It wasn't Tom, was it?
I'm so glad you're OK.
I'm so glad you're OK.
Tom says he can see you at 2:30.
There were no problems.

What brought you here?
What else would you like to know?

Why couldn't you do that?
Did Tom give you something?
We often do what we have to do, not what we want to do.
I love the food here.

I am completely against it.
Yes, please do.
I'm sorry, Tom, I can't do that.

We did our best to help him, but he didn't so much as say thank you.
I understand that this is a difficult decision for you.
Do your work quickly.
I wish I didn't have to work.
You're not the one who died.

If you really don't want to come, you don't have to.
Nobody wants him to come.
Tom left with no notice.
Don't call him that.
Don't call him that.
Tom waited, but nobody came.
Tom told me to tell you he's fine.
Tom told me to do it, so I did it.
Tom seems to be telling the truth.
Tom never told me where he worked.
Tom doesn't always tell the truth.
Tell me where you were last night.
Tell me where you were last night.
Tell me about your new girlfriend.
Please tell your friends about it.
What am I supposed to tell them?
When will you give me your answer?
We have to tell someone.
Tom told me where to go.
They told me everything.
Tell us what's going on.
Tell me about your children.
Someone should tell Tom.
Let me tell you a story.
Just tell us what to do.
Just tell Tom the truth.
I was going to tell you.
It's my biggest problem.
Tom, put your money away. I'm paying this time.
Tom will die without your help.
Tom will die without your help.
May you be happy, Ricardo.
His wife's a friend of mine.
It's for a friend of mine.
She came to my aid.
She is my best friend.
Is that really you?
Keep in mind what I tell you.
It's the best house in town.
I wanted to have children.
I was very young when that happened.
I was very young when that happened.
Let's not talk about school.
What do you two usually talk about?
Think of your future.
Should we continue?
I know you're afraid.
I haven't seen him in a long time.
Get him!
Don't be a baby.
I think he didn't understand.
I'm going to mail this letter.
I think he didn't understand.
Is it already open?
He's a good boy.
I fucked your mother.
We need three more chairs.
I have to answer this letter right away.
Do you know these guys?
I think that you're not studying enough.
Who did Tom mean?
Who are you guys?
I saw him reading a book.
Just follow your heart.
Thanks to all of you.
We have had little snow this winter.
Do you believe in guardian angels?
Do you believe in guardian angels?
Tom doesn't have the right to say that.
Forget what I just said.
I've already decided.
I've asked everybody.
Mine is the red one.
Don't go, my dears.
I think I have a solution.
It just kept getting worse and worse.
Forget what I just told you.
I wish I lived in Switzerland.
Let us turn now to the fundamental issue.
I'm not ready for a relationship.
I'm not ready for a relationship.
We used to work together.
We did it together.
I take back everything I've said.
What would Tom think?
Do you happen to know when Tom is coming back?
Have you been to Australia?
I usually eat at home with my family.
I knew you would come.
We have what we deserve.
That's just the way Tom is.
Absolutely!
Empty your pockets.
I cannot open this jar. I don't have enough strength. "Let me do that."
Let's play.
Let's ask him.
I think Tom is afraid of you.
They believe you.
They believe you.
What did you give me?
What did Tom give to you?
What did Tom give to you?
Let's go to my place.
Let's go to my place.
You've never told me about that.
You never told me about this.
You've been told not to do that.
You've been told not to do that.
The car started.
The car stopped.
We've got to leave.
Who's in control?
Is there any bread?
I don't mind telling you what I know.
Can I be honest with you?
I'd like to ask a favor.
I'm coming for you.
He was master of the situation.
What did you two talk about?
Tom believes in life after death.
Tom has been stabbed to death.
Tom had to make a decision.
At first, I didn't know what to do.
I didn't believe him at first.
Did you behave today?
I don't feel like eating now.
He brought me a coffee even though I had asked for a tea.
Why didn't you think of that before?
Why didn't you think of that before?
I don't know where to put them.
I'm right behind you.
I've only heard good things about him.
Tom knows what I'm talking about.
Tom knows what I'm talking about.
Do you want me to tell Tom?
Do you want me to tell Tom?
Do you want me to tell Tom?
Do you want me to tell Tom?
Why should I believe you?
Tom doesn't like to talk about that.
I know you're telling the truth.
I know you're telling the truth.
Tom talked to me about that already.
Tom doesn't like to talk about his past.
Do you want to talk about it or not?
Do you want to talk about it or not?
It's hard for Tom to talk about that.
You know who I'm talking about, right?
You know who I'm talking about, right?
We've talked about this many times before.
That's exactly what Tom was talking about.
I talked to Tom about this for a long time.
Tom doesn't like to talk about his problems.
Tom didn't want to talk about what happened.
Tom didn't want to talk about what had happened.
Why do we live?
Marilyn Monroe died when she was 36 years old.
This is hard for you, isn't it?
Don't forget to write.
Don't forget to write.
We are finally free.
However, I won't know whether he came or not.
How can I just tell Tom without telling everybody else?
Tom thought it was a good solution.
Tom thought it was a good solution.
You have to give me time.
You have to give me time.
You have to give me time.
No one has an answer.
We are waiting for him to make another decision.
How did Tom behave?
Is that what Tom wants?
Is this what Tom wanted?
Just do what Tom says.
Just do what Tom says.
Tell Tom what you mean.
Tell Tom what you mean.
I neither walk nor run.
I want to forget her.
I told you Tom wouldn't help.
This is what Tom would do.
What would you have said to Tom?
What would you have said to Tom?
What would Tom have done first?
What's Tom doing over there?
What was Tom doing here?
That's the reason I don't like him.
That's the reason I don't like her.
I wanted to be like her.
I wanted to be like her.
I wanted to be like him.
I wanted to be like him.
I wanted to be like them.
I wanted to be like them.
I wanted to be like them.
I wanted to be like them.
I wanted to be like her.
I wanted to be like her.
I wanted to be like him.
I wanted to be like him.
He's out of practice.
I heard every word.
I heard about what happened.
If only we had a son!
How do I forget her?
She didn't want me to join up the army.
She can't understand my feelings.
Some feelings are difficult to describe.
Tom is the enemy.
I wish I hadn't said that.
It was a long time ago.
You're just like your mother.
I'll never forget my first kiss.
What would you suggest?
What would you suggest?
We've really got to hurry.
We've got everything under control here.
We have more than enough food.
We've been together long enough.
We made a decision.
We've waited a long time for this day.
We did what we could.
We did it already.
We've heard this before.
We've never done it before.
We've done it many times before.
We did what we could.
Tom isn't like his brother.
Nobody else knew about it.
Please do what you consider necessary.
I know what I'd do.
Bring me some cold water.
He will make a good doctor.
My son, do you believe in God? "Yes, my father."
Tom was disgusted.
He left his wife.
One fork is missing.
What's that in your pocket?
What're you listening to?
I thought you were leaving.
I thought you were leaving.
How did the photo session go?
It's all you can do for now.
It's all you can do for now.
This is the rule of the game.
The only one who can solve this problem is you.
Tom is the only one who can solve this problem.
Do you know that guy?
I don't want him to die.
If there is no God, everything is permitted.
If there is no God, everything is permitted.
I'm not going to talk to you anymore.
She's a precocious one eh?
Can you do me a favor? "It depends."
You're the only one who can solve this problem.
You're the only one who can solve this problem.
You're the only one who can solve this problem.
You're the only one who can solve this problem.
I have got some books.
He doesn’t have tea every morning
He has tea every morning.
My son can't count yet.
You aren't ready.
You're so strong.
You're so tall.
It must've been someone else.
Isn't it time for you to leave?
Isn't it time for you to leave?
Is Tom out of his mind?
What a shot!
I came to you because I need your help.
Tom says he wants me to leave, but I don't think he really means it.
I thought maybe you could help me.
We forgot.
Can you stand on your hands?
Can you stand on your hands?
We don't need anyone's help.
Who brought the beer?
You think I don't know who you are, don't you?
What else can I do for you?
You've been here all night, haven't you?
Tom might hear you.
You should find somebody else to help you.
Tom could help you.
Tom could help you.
I'm not your girlfriend.
How long ago was that?
You need sleep.
You need sleep.
I don't really like him.
I don't really like her.
If Tom doesn't want to go, he doesn't have to.
What is it you'd like to know?
What is it you'd like to know?
This stone is beautiful. Where did you find it?
This stone is beautiful. Where did you find it?
This stone is beautiful. Where did you find it?
You are the master of your own destiny.
You will be told where to sit.
My mother is out.
Two years went by before I could find a good job.
Give me the number.
Everyone has a right to say what he thinks.
That isn't much, is it?
What can you tell us about this?
I'll show you the way.
You're still smiling.
Don't tell me you forgot.
Where is my time machine?
Aren't you sleepy?
Aren't you sleepy?
He answered not a word to me.
You're not the only one Tom asked.
You're not the only one Tom asked.
Had I had a little more money, I would have bought it.
Tom didn't go, and neither did I.
Why do you want to kill us?
Tom didn't have anyone to play with.
Tom didn't have anyone to play with.
Tom didn't hear his name being called.
Tom didn't know how to solve this problem.
Tom didn't know if he could do it or not.
Tom will come back soon.
Tom didn't know where he should go.
Tom didn't know where to go.
Tomorrow is the big day.
We know all about you.
We know all about you.
We know what happened.
We know what happened.
Tom doesn't do things like that.
You're all against me.
Are you ready for that?
Are you ready for that?
Do you know what to do?
Do you know what to do?
I'll never buy another one of these.
That's a pretty picture.
You may stay here with me.
You may stay here with me.
I smile every time I see her.
Wait, did you say girl or guy?
Maybe you're seeing what you want to see.
What do you think of your own face?
Tom left the restaurant without paying.
Emily is learning Danish, because she and her parents are going to Denmark this summer.
I'm all out of money.
That's exactly what Tom was afraid of.
I'm beat. I've been working from dawn to dusk.
I was ready.
Everyone here is named Tom.
Who knows the answers?
Tom doesn't want to do this.
Tom doesn't want to hear it.
He is easy to talk to.
I shouldn't have believed Tom.
We had a good conversation.
Was there a reason?
I didn't even know your name.
I didn't even know your name.
Have you got any idea what I'm talking about?
Let's get cracking!
Maybe you should ask.
That car is really expensive.
We must work now.
I am a little out of sorts today.
Tom came forward.
I'm out of shape.
I should call a doctor.
I know that life is short.
I knew you'd stay.
Let bygones be bygones.
Tom was my friend.
I had not gone far before it began to rain.
OK, I'll leave you alone.
Money can't buy life.
I think it's time for me to call a doctor.
I thought we already did that.
You can't take that with you.
You can take that with you.
Did Marika write you letters in Finnish?
It's going to happen today.
Do you really think that?
I think I've understood.
Has everyone gone crazy?
Has everyone gone crazy?
Tom began to work for our company three years ago.
I'll stay a while longer if you want me to.
I can't decide what to do.
The entire town was under water.
Do you remember how to do this?
Do you remember how to do this?
Someone will do it.
I just wanted to see you one last time.
I just wanted to see you one last time.
I just wanted to see you one last time.
I just wanted to see you one last time.
Does Tom know why?
Are we all ready?
Why should I pay?
Don't you know?
Will you do that?
You have a beautiful apartment.
What could you do?
Is Tom still sick?
What am I doing?
How's your leg?
Don't you know me?
The box was empty.
I'd better go away.
They won't stay.
That's easy to say.
I'm your boss now.
Why should I wait?
We've got to help her.
We've got to help him.
We've got to help them.
I don't know where she went.
I do need your help.
Is your wife at home?
I've decided to stay where I am.
My father always speaks in a very loud voice.
I wanted to be there.
My father brought me here by car.
My father used to eat at this restaurant.
Everything Bush says is true.
I don't want to think about it.
I'm not going to tell you.
Don't tell Tom. He'll tell everyone.
Tom isn't afraid of snakes.
Tom is very afraid of snakes.
We all liked Tom.
I'll write to Tom.
I read the old documents.
He was an utter stranger.
He is quite a clever man.
He wasn't exactly a stranger.
He looks just like his mother.
He was not at all satisfied.
How do you even know that?
I certainly don't mind helping you.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
We will get there in two hours.
I should've listened more carefully.
He and his sisters are currently living in Tokyo.
I think we'll stay for a couple more hours.
I just want to stay here for a couple of hours.
I can't believe you.
The exact same thing happened to me.
No matter how I try, I can't forget that kiss.
I even wrote a letter to Tom.
I even wrote a letter to Tom.
The dog is walking around the table.
I really want to be a good friend, but it is hard.
How do you plan on paying for that?
It's your life.
Leave our house.
Leave our house.
It's not yours.
It's not yours.
Your French is getting better.
Did you speak to my father yesterday?
Did you speak to my father yesterday?
Does Tom know why he's coming here?
I think I should've helped Tom.
I should've done what Tom asked.
We should've been told about it.
I should've gone there with you.
That's what I should've done.
I should've told you the truth.
Tell me what I should've done.
Tell me what I should've done.
This is not yellow; it's green.
You should've kept your mouth shut.
I should've paid closer attention.
I should've bought more food.
I should've said something earlier.
You should've seen your face.
I should've stayed in bed.
You should've seen the fire.
You should've seen what happened.
I should've gone with you.
Maybe I should've told Tom.
We should've planned more carefully.
We should've done that ourselves.
Why do you want that anyway?
You're part of me.
He pretended to be sleeping.
Tom got a new pair of glasses.
I'm afraid I don't understand that.
Please give that to me.
She doesn't listen to me.
He is not as tall as his father.
The forest burned for days.
You can open the window.
He would sooner rather die than work for that man.
Do you really think that Tom won't come?
I understand it's going to get hot again.
He who knows, does not speak. He who speaks, does not know.
It was just a fling.
Nobody wants to be my friend anymore.
Tom asked me to tell you that.
Aren't you coming inside?
OK people, listen up.
Last night I read a book.
I can't really describe it.
I should've done this months ago.
My friends stood by me during the process.
Here's what we're going to do.
I have waited a full three hours.
I'd better go.
She is playing with her friends.
You probably also know about what Tom did.
I told her to be home by nine.
I stopped by the supermarket on my way home.
Get out or come in.
I want you to be my friend.
She left home just now.
We trusted you.
I should be in charge.
Tom certainly had something to say.
I think Tom will return soon.
We haven't found the gun yet.
I told you Tom wouldn't let us down.
Answer me quickly, or I'll die.
I told Tom I couldn't do that.
She is writing a new book this year.
I will go for a medical.
This country needs a new president.
Tom got on the airplane.
Would you like to see what I just made?
The other day I saw the girl.
Aren't you afraid?
Did you understand what she said?
Did you understand what she said?
I'm thirsty.
My name is "The Strange One".
Tom got up from his seat.
Tom got up from his seat.
He has been to England twice.
I think I need to go.
You need not have come in such a hurry.
He almost died.
Tom sleeps with his window open.
The only person I know here is Tom.
Tom left his apartment at 2:30.
Tom isn't ready to be a father.
Where was your father?
Tom didn't use to be like that.
Is there anything you want from the supermarket?
The classroom was almost empty.
I'm not talking about that now.
I'm not talking about that now.
Do you want to kill me?
I'm not sure how that happened.
How could you do this to me?
I'll never forget what you did.
I'll never forget what you did.
I'll never forget what you did.
I'll never forget what you did.
I'll have to take this with me.
I'll be there in a few minutes.
I'll be back in twenty minutes.
I'll answer all your questions.
I'm learning German now.
You don't need my help.
You don't need my help.
You don't need me anymore.
You don't need me anymore.
He saved the situation.
Do you believe in such things?
We get together once a month.
That's not something I want to think about right now.
Is this happening today?
Tom lives just around the corner.
Let's do this.
The boy went to school.
I'm glad I'm alive.
May your soul rest in peace.
What books did you buy?
What books did you buy?
What books did you buy?
What books did you buy?
I thought you did that last week.
I thought you did that last week.
I thought you did that last week.
I thought you did that last week.
I've only done this once before.
I've only done this once before.
He will not stay for more than four days.
All the windows were open.
He's right behind you.
She's right behind you.
He's right behind you.
She's right behind you.
They're right behind you.
I know who you were with.
I know who you were with.
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
This is my plan.
That's my plan.
That's my plan.
I'm glad I'm a man.
Tom told me what he thought of my plan.
Tom told me what he thought of my plan.
Tom asked me to open the window.
How did you get into the house?
How did you get into the house?
She introduced me to her father.
I have the feeling that I've seen these shoes somewhere before.
Are you the author of this book?
The answer is simple.
Tom is in the other room.
What would Tom have done in my place?
Tom isn't going to say no.
Tom introduced his sister to me.
I wish I were by your side.
What he said may well be true.
I couldn't remember his name.
How much money you would like to withdraw?
I want to deposit some money.
Does he come here every week?
How did you do it so quickly?
Tom is still your best friend, isn't he?
Tom is still your friend, isn't he?
I will tell you the history of my life.
I will tell you the history of my life.
Not all men are like that.
She doesn't resemble her mother at all.
You must make your own decisions.
You must make your own decisions.
What was she thinking?
What was he thinking?
What time did you get up today?
What time did you get up today?
This never happens.
He has no heart at all.
Everest is the highest mountain in the world.
Father usually comes home at eight.
Follow that car!
It all happened three months ago.
Tell Tom to stop.
If this is coffee, bring me tea; but if this is tea, bring me coffee.
I'm not your slave!
Tom read a book.
We don't have that in Europe.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
I have to go pack.
It's really worth it.
It's really worth it.
Can you answer me?
Can you answer me?
That is what this is about.
So many places, I haven't been to.
I wish you were with me.
I wish you were with me.
I'm ready! Can we go?
What language do you usually speak at work?
What language do you usually speak at work?
Tom doesn't care what people think about him.
If Tom had asked me for some money, I'd have given it to him.
I want to open my own restaurant.
I don't think either of us wants that to happen.
I don't think either of us wants that to happen.
It's worse than that.
Tom won't be able to come here tomorrow.
Everyone keeps on smiling.
You are my true friend!
I told you Tom isn't my friend.
I told you Tom isn't my friend.
He called my name.
I can't open this bottle.
Did you solve the problem?
Tom asked me why I was laughing.
Tom asked me why I was smiling.
He wasn't your brother.
May I hold your hand?
He never existed.
This girl has become a woman.
I don't want to play this game.
Tom said you'd never come.
She never existed.
I'd like a first-class ticket.
I decided to tell her that I love her.
I decided to tell her that it was her that I loved.
Give me that book.
He works eight hours a day.
Why are you asking?
The two books are equivalent in value.
They had big plans for you.
Tom wants to open his own restaurant.
She is neither at home nor at school.
What you said is true.
He got up earlier than usual.
He got up earlier than usual.
Tom wants to be loved.
I want to eat something that isn't sweet.
We don't have any money left.
I hardly recognized you.
I hardly recognized you.
I almost didn't recognize you.
I almost didn't recognize you.
I hardly recognized you.
I hardly recognized you.
Tom pretended not to notice.
Tom doesn't listen to anyone.
Tom got up and left the room.
I wish I could live my life doing only what I wanted to do.
You may go on condition that you return by five.
I'm 24 years old and I haven't had a boyfriend in 6 years.
Thank you for your kindness.
I would've said yes.
I would've said yes.
What were you trying to do?
What were you trying to do?
Tell me about it. I'm all ears.
Do you like your work?
Jesus walked on water.
Please give me a little more time.
Tom heard his name being called.
I want to know the truth about my son's death.
Tom is a guest.
Tom is about to go.
I spend too much time on Tatoeba.
It's not the end of the story yet.
We will have to call on our friends to help us.
Tom is telling the truth.
The men are hungry.
What is worse: Love without money or money without love?
I always cry when I see this picture.
Would you like to go with me? "You bet!"
I want to go there once again.
We both know what's out there.
We can deal with them.
We tried to stop them.
We tried to stop them.
I consider him my enemy.
What kind of books do you like?
Did Tom talk about it?
Is it easy for me to solve this problem?
I was really angry.
You needed to arrive earlier.
Is that a paper?
Yours is worse.
I bought this for my friend.
Tom isn't afraid of you.
Tom isn't afraid of you.
She came back an hour later.
Tom knows something that he's not telling us.
Tom looked at his watch.
Tom needs me.
Tom needs me.
Tom never returned.
Do you go to school on Sundays?
Mother bought me the book.
Tom never listens to me.
He passed away.
Tom said that he doesn't know the answer.
Tom says he never thought about that.
Are we already leaving?
How can I say "I love you" in your language?
My glasses started to slip down my nose.
Watch your step, Tom.
Tom slowly walked backwards.
Tom began to laugh.
Tom stepped into the shower.
Tom told me that he wasn't feeling very good.
Tom turned out to be just like his father.
Tom walked toward the entrance.
Tom was right.
I haven't done this in ages.
You're not as clever as you think.
We all knew about it.
We knew all about it.
We knew all about it.
Take a shower.
Take a shower.
I think Tom did well.
Tom was with us.
Why didn't you tell me? "You never asked."
Why didn't you tell me? "You never asked."
Why didn't you tell me? "You never asked."
Why didn't you tell me? "You never asked."
I love him... I think.
Tom died last winter.
There's a hair in my soup.
There isn't anybody here.
I decided to tell her that it was her that I loved.
You must help Tom.
You must help Tom.
You must help Tom.
I learned a lot this week.
Am I doing it right?
You wouldn't remember.
Tom comes here every three days.
Tom comes here twice a week.
Tom could've died.
Tom couldn't answer their questions.
Tom couldn't come because he was sick.
Tom couldn't come because he was sick.
Tom decided not to go with us.
Tom decided not to wait any longer.
Tom decided to go with us.
Tom did as I told him.
Tom left his son a fortune.
I would've said no.
Tom didn't agree with me.
Tom didn't answer my question.
Tom didn't answer the phone.
Tom didn't do what I asked.
Tom didn't give me time to think.
We're your friends, Tom.
Tom never told anyone about what he had done that day.
You knew, didn't you?
Don't talk to your mother that way.
It's giving me a headache.
Tell me exactly what you heard.
Tell Tom I'm still in a meeting.
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
I want to open my own restaurant.
Tom wants to open his own restaurant.
I want to open my own restaurant.
My full name is Ricardo Vernaut, Junior.

I really don't know what to suggest.
Can you answer the question, please?
There's something strange going on here.
I don't know what more I can do to help.

That's something worth thinking about.
Tom sat down again.
She understood me.
She understood me.
What language do they speak in your country?
What a nice thought!
Do you plan to continue working until 10:00?
Some people don't know that.
Do you like it when I do this?

Tom couldn't wipe the smile off his face.
I want to know why you did that.

Tom asked me if I would help him.
Come here, Tom.
Don't go, Tom.

A boy of seventeen is usually as tall as his father.
I asked him not to drive fast.

When's that supposed to happen?
Oh. You're alive? "Yes. Where is everyone?" "Dunno."
Mary just got her hair done.
Maybe Tom is telling the truth.
This is the book that Tom was talking about yesterday.
The book costs five dollars.
I thought Tom had already gone home.
I can't tell you what happened.
Russia is bigger than Italy.
He said he did not do it.
Tom would like to know the reason.
I don't want to die tomorrow.
I don't want to die tomorrow.
Every bus is full.
Let me know, when you are ready!

Tom can barely walk.
Thanks for the book.
Tell them the truth.
Who was in the car?
Who was in the car?
I don't want to answer that question.

He was always different.
You never believed me.
Can Tom come, too?
My room has three windows.
I don't believe that either.
I want to die, but I cannot.
The girl smiled at him, but he did not smile back.
I want to make a pie.
I want to make friends with your sister.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
Thank you for agreeing to help me.
Do you do this every day?
Do you do this every day?
He went on board the plane.
My parents don't know where I am.
Are you writing a letter?
I haven't received any answer yet.
I haven't got any reply so far.

You've been a very bad boy.
Everybody's in position.
It had to happen somewhere.
That should've never happened.
It's all happening so fast.
Just tell us what happened.
Something's happening here.
That'll never happen again.
What happened the next day?
What happened to your face?
What really happened to us?
My band's playing tonight.
Tom got back in his car.
Tom doesn't seem too busy.
Please just give it to me.
Give us a couple of hours.
Tom said to give you this.
Tom was sitting up straight.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Do you want to go with us?
Does Tom want to go with us?
I think you might be able to help me.
I think you didn't do it.
Tom has never eaten caviar.
I'm really glad to hear it.
I'm really mad at you guys.

Do you think it's easier to be a single mother or a single father?
Tom got up at 7:00.
Tom needed the money.
I've never had a girlfriend.
Tom signed in.
Tom was quiet.
Tom, I'm back.
Tom, I'm back.
Tom walks fast.
It could still happen.
I think Tom is chubby.
I'm not going to Tom's.
I agreed to buy it.
How can Tom do this?
We came only today.
A great deal has happened since that time.
I wanted to show them your book.
Are you about to do it?
Money can't buy friends.
Where's your other brother?
If I can do it, so can you.
He has more than a thousand books.
You know your rights.
You can tell Tom.
Tom owed me a lot of money.
How are you going to help Tom?
You have to come now.
I have already seen this man.

Tom is afraid because he doesn't understand what's going on.
I know about you guys.
I'm still afraid of you.
Tom told me it was none of my business.
Shut up or I'll shut you up!
I got a job.
We already know you did it.
I'll pay whatever it costs.
Some books are worth reading over and over again.
I've been spending evenings with Tom.
You can't understand.
I've been spending every morning with Tom.
You can't understand.
Keep in mind that language is your friend and not your enemy.
She knows the way.
Excuse me. What's your name?
Tom really needs our help.
Tom said you needed a job.
You're not tired, are you?
You've been through a lot.
Tom can't hold his liquor.
I was the last one to see him.
Did Tom send you?
Who sent you here?
Tom sent one to me.
Who sent Tom?

Who sent you that?
I became first.
Why do we need them here?
Why do we need Tom here?
Why do we need him here?

Can you tell me why we need to do this?
You may sit down.
We gave them everything we had.
We live together.
We should study English every day.
We must work as long as we live.
He looks upon his work as a game.
Tom was too scared to yell.
Do you drink black coffee?

Everybody had a good time.
What's in those boxes?
Do you like to play games?

You're in a hurry, aren't you?
We shouldn't have written that.

What happened last month?
What happened there?
What happened to you two?
What just happened there?
What should I talk about?
Where were they standing?
You told me to come here.
I want answers.
You didn't see what I saw.
I did it many times.
Can we do it another time?
Tom pointed to his watch.
What's all this got to do with Tom?
You told Tom something, didn't you?
I looked in Tom's eyes.
I can come back if you want me to.
Why did Tom buy a new car?
Tom walked away.
All the boys went away.

He soon walked away.
She walked away without saying good bye.

Do you need any more help?

Is Tom still sleeping?
I can't accept that.
I don't know whether I should believe Tom or not.
Someone asked about Texas.
Who are you writing to?
Why can't I go?

Well, what should I do?
It doesn't get any easier.
We all know what'll happen.

Tom won't leave his dog with you.
Why aren't you studying?

We'd like a little time to ourselves.
When's Tom coming?
Why are we still alive?
What else did you have?

Would you please send this letter by airmail?
She tried.
I told Tom to stop.
I told Tom to stop.
Do you think you're normal?
I think you'll not be able to do that.
Tom put his room in order.
Don't expect everyone to think the same way you do.
We're still working on it.
Don't expect everyone to think the same way you do.
We've all heard about you.
I want to get involved with business strategy.
We can open the window.
We only need one.
I know what she did.
Tom was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I knew Tom was studying.
I knew Tom was studying.
I knew Tom wasn't dead.

Can you tell me what you're doing?
You'd better tell me what happened.
Can we have a menu, please?
It doesn't seem like what we should be doing right now.
He wrote me four letters.
I'll become stronger.
This is how you repay me for my kindness?
I have a strange problem.
Are they sleeping together?
You're not getting away from me that easily, Tom.
You know you don't have to do this, Tom.
I'm having a hard time understanding you.
I'm having a hard time understanding you.
I'm having a hard time answering your question.
I don't understand why he did that.
Tom has lived alone ever since his wife died.
I pretended that I didn't see it.
Did he laugh at you?
Did he laugh at you?
Did she laugh at you?
Did she laugh at you?
I've never been to Oslo.
We talked about this yesterday.
This just had to happen today of all days!
Anyone can do that.
I'm not allowed to talk about that.
Please don't tell Tom about this.
How exactly did you do that?
I'll go next month.
No one man could do it.
It's hard, but I'm going to make it!
Do we have to decide today?
Tell me about what you did today.
Tell me about what you did today.
Tell me about what you did today.
Tom almost died today.
I admit that I killed him.
Were you able to do everything you wanted to get done?
Were you able to do everything you wanted to get done?
What's wrong with everyone today?
Everything seemed OK.
Do you really think I'm ready?
Do you remember what happened?
I'll tell Tom if I don't forget.
I'll tell Tom if I don't forget.
I can't cough up the phlegm because it's too deep in my bronchi.
We need supplies.
Tom realized that he wasn't the same as the other kids.
Our city used to be a village.
It was the wrong thing to do.
Put it back.
Put it back.
Put that back.
Put it back.
What did I forget to say?
He asked for my assistance.
There's no one named Tom here.
I like this jacket.
Give me the book.
I was going to write to you, but I forgot.
I was going to write to you, but I forgot.
Who's gonna read such a thick book?
Is it true Tom can't read or write?

Tom didn't quite know how to respond to the question.
Tell us a little about your family.
Tell us a little about your family.
Tell us a little about your family.
Tom is waiting in the hallway.
I want you to leave right away.
It just wasn't meant to be.
It's better not to go there alone.
It's better not to go there alone.
Tom tried to run.
Tom writes a letter to his mother every week.
Tell me what to write and I'll write it for you.
I was going to suggest the following possibility.
This is really beautiful.
I don't feel like doing it.
We have way too much work to do.
I have to study now.
English is pretty hard, isn't it?
Tom stepped back.
They saw something strange.
Did you know Tom plays the trombone?
Did you know Tom plays the trombone?
We don't even know if it's true.
ׁWhy didn't Tom tell the truth?
Next time, it's your turn.
I could hardly understand him.
He just smiled.
She just smiled.
Just sit there.
What did you do that afternoon?
It's very hard to understand.
I boarded the plane.
Are you with us or against us?
Are you with us or against us?
What else can you do for us?

Tom didn't tell me about you.

Tom didn't tell me about you.
Here's my friend's ticket.
Did I do something wrong?
Why didn't you just take the money?
Did I do something wrong?
Tom isn't who you think he is.
You will tell me everything.
Don't you want to go with us?
Don't you want to go with us?
Tom sat with his legs crossed.
Tom says he'll think about it.
I just want to be a good person.
Perhaps Tom is sleeping.
Perhaps you can help.
I don't know much about Australia.
Just give me a little time.
She asked him to sit down.
The weather had been hot.
Can you remember the first time you heard the Beatles?
You do what you have to do.
You don't need me for this.
Are you sure you can't stay?
Haven't you had enough, Tom?
Tell me the truth.
I don't want to think about it anymore.
You're Tom, right?
I'm the youngest child.
Do you think they noticed?
Do you think they noticed?
This is the first thing I do each morning.
How beautifully you write!
Do you still believe that?
Do you still believe that?

You've got to help them.
You've got to come with me.
You've got a bus to catch.
You've got a bus to catch.
Tom is staying.
Tom stopped.
Who yelled?
Tom was shouting.
I'm inclined to believe Tom.
I'm not allowed to go there.
Tom wouldn't do this.
I don't think it's even possible.
I'm just telling you what I've heard.
I'm beginning to realize that myself.
I'm afraid Tom won't be able to come.
Did you hear what Tom did?
Did you hear what Tom did?
You're wrong about that.
I'll never ask you for anything else.
I'll never ask you for anything else.
I'll let Tom know that we can't come.
I'll do everything I can to help you.
I'll do everything I can to help you.
I was afraid you wouldn't understand.
I was afraid you wouldn't understand.
I want to know why Tom couldn't come.
You do understand, don't you?
You don't believe it, do you?
You don't even know his name.
I told everybody about what happened.
I told everybody about what happened.
Do you know what's happened?
What do you think I did?
What do you think I did?
What do you think Tom did?
What do you think Tom did?
If Tom didn't write this, then who did?
Why can't you do what you're told?
Why can't you do what you're told?
Who's your best friend?
What can it be?
Is that your ex-wife?
How is that even possible?
Tom was about to say something.
We'll have to do this later.
We're doing the best we can.
Why are you doing this here?
It is high time you went to bed.
It is high time you were in bed.
It is high time you were in bed.
It is high time you went to bed.
It is high time you went to bed.
You'll die if you stay here.
You're asking the wrong guy.
I thought they'd never leave.
It's too cold in here for me.
Tom will help you if you ask.
Tom won't go along with that.
Tom won't go to school today.
I won't be responsible for my actions.
I'm not about to tell you that you're right.
That makes me feel better.
Tom was the only one who smiled.
Tom was unable to answer.
It's been a bad week.
It's been a rough week.
My life's an open book.
If you wanted more cake, all you had to do was ask.
It's all quite normal.
It could be cancer.
Tom can no longer walk without a cane.
You said you were going to buy a new car.
You said you were going to buy a new car.
Tom got back into the car.
Come to my house.
Come home.
I'll be back in a few hours.
We haven't been introduced.
We should get back to work.
Tom won't let me help him.
We both know why I'm here.
He decided to become her husband.
What is your phone number?
What is your phone number?
We'll be here all week.
We know where you've been.
Tom would have told us.

Tom has asked us for help.
They're all against me.
That's my problem, not yours.
That's my problem, not yours.
How did you find Tom?
I would rather stay at home than go out on such a cold day.
I know what you're probably thinking.
I know what you're probably thinking.
She was too shocked to speak.
I want to go to Bali.
Tom loves to play with my dog.
Tom ran his fingers through his hair.
Why are rabbits' ears big?
Tom won't go with you.
Tom won't go with you.
I really wish I knew what Tom plans to do.
Where is the nearest restaurant?
Call it whatever you want.
I don't know if you remember me.
I don't know if you remember me.
I thought you were in charge.
Are you going to ask her?
Are you going to ask her?
Look what we have here.
So, what's your secret?
Tell me what I must do.
Do you still have my number?
Do your children have their own rooms?
She is as beautiful as her mother.
I've never thought about that before.
You're scared to death, aren't you?
You're scared to go home, aren't you?
Did you hear what I just said?
Let's think about it together.
We're not going to let that happen.
We won't allow this to happen.
Tom is staying at his uncle's.
Did you really not know that?
Did you really not know that?
You do your job, I'll do mine.
You could've sent Tom some money.
Did Tom ask you about that?
Did Tom ask you about that?
What's so good about that?
Do you really want that?
What's that have to do with me?
Why don't we stay another hour?
I'll tell Tom you asked about him.
Are you really going to eat that?
Are you really going to eat that?
Did Tom ask you to do it?

What right do they have to do that?
What right do they have to do that?
What right do they have to do that?
What right do they have to do that?
I'm on the phone.
I couldn't have done better myself.
I don't know why someone else can't do this.
I'd like for Tom to tell you what he did on Friday night.
Tom, there's a policeman here to see you.
How do you know her name?
How do you know her name?
How do you know his name?

I want people to know the truth.
Get me my glasses.
Tom is a writer.
Tom is against it.
Tom is always eating.
Tom doesn't really understand.
How many of them were there?
How many of these are yours?
How many of us were there?
How many of you live here?
How many other guys named Tom do you know?
How many other people know about this?
Tom was really sick.
You should come with us.
You shouldn't stay here.
You were right as usual.
Tom had to stop.
I think I'll go to bed.
How does Tom do this?
It's not getting worse.
Just tell me the truth.
Tom knows the drill.
This one's still alive.
Why doesn't she write me anymore?
It'll happen to you, too.
Just stay out of our way.
You can't just walk away.
What's the big deal? People do this all the time.
Tell Tom he has to leave.
Can't you do it any faster?
Where else could it be?
Pretend you don't know them.
Pretend you don't know them.
Tom believed everything I told him.
Is that your mom?
Why were you silent all the time?

I think I did well.
Please don't tell Tom about our plan.

This is the best hotel in town.

That's what Tom wants.
Is it true that you weren't here yesterday?

Do you know if Tom is here?
I saw your brother the other day.
The pain never goes away.
The pain never went away.

That might help.
That couldn't be.
That didn't happen.
That isn't true.
That just happened.
That never happens.
Tom never said who he was with last night.
I have few books.
You are what you eat.
I want to be like Tom.
Would you like to go with me?
Would you like to go with me?
Would you like to go with me?
You would never understand.
She kept the letter.
You're my best friend, Tom.
Tom, you're wanted on the phone.
Do you want to hear about what Tom did?
We're nearly out of time.
Tom couldn't walk without a cane.
Tom is the only one I'll talk to.
Tom is walking down the corridor.
Tom knows what to do, doesn't he?
Everything's in your room.
Give Tom what he asks for.
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.
What is the telephone number of the ambulance?
I also went there.
I can make it in two hours.
What else happened yesterday?
Tom must be somewhere around here.
Water is 800 times heavier than air.
You may sit down on the chair.

Why was it in your car?

Water is life.
Why don't you go there?

She slowly opened her eyes.
Why aren't they coming?
Where were you sitting?

I thought Tom would buy that car.
You'll never see us again.

How old were you when your father died?
How old were you when your father died?
How old were you when your father died?
Well, if you didn't do it, then who did?
Have I made the right decision?
It's the right decision.
Tom didn't agree with our decision.
That was a tough decision.
Have you reached a decision?
What was the cause of death?
If you want to stay here, you are welcome to.

Put it on the shelf.
Put it on the shelf.
Put it on the shelf.

Open your eyes, Tom.
Nobody went with me.
Perhaps Tom was wrong.
Maybe it wasn't Tom.
Let's do this later.
I'll show that to Tom.
There's no one in the classroom.
Tom will go there with me.
Men have about 7 to 8 times more testosterone than women.
Once you start, you will never stop.
Somebody tried to kill us.
He comes here every five days.
Tom doesn't know how it happened.
I can't help Tom with that.
Japan is not what it was 15 years ago.
What are you so afraid of telling me?
Maybe Tom should've told you that.

Where were you 3 years ago?
You must work together.
The children are playing under the lime tree.
You are very busy.
A few months later he left the rock band.
Why did you become a police officer?

Has it occurred to you that Tom might be able to help us solve the problem?

Remember what we talked about?
Remember what we talked about?
Do we have to talk about this?
Can we not talk about it here?
You never talk about your wife.
It's not really food.
We know very little about it.
Tom would never kill himself.
I really don't remember.
Tom is reading a book about the history of Australia.
Why is your mouth open?
I don't need you.
If you have a question, please raise your hand.
He does not have anyone to play with.
This used to be my room.
I did my work.
What are they doing now?
I had to do this today.
I had to do this today.
I had to do this today.
I don't know where we'll go tomorrow.
Don't you see what's happening?
Has Tom told you what happened?
I'm exactly where I want to be.
I'm doing this for my family.
I'm the one who loves you.
My son has a son.
I want to write an article.
Don't give it to him. Give it to me.
Don't give it to him. Give it to me.
Don't give it to him. Give it to me.
I've just seen the results.
What happened to your hair?
Tom wouldn't have anything to do with me.
Is that even a word?
Don't you speak Tatoeban?
I like your hair that way.
Tom isn't afraid.
I don't pretend to understand women.
Tom is trying to help you.
Pull yourself together, Tom.
You need a heart transplant.
You never told me your name.
You really mean a lot to me.
You really need to see this.
Tom put down his suitcase.
Why do I need help?
Do it again, Tom.
Do it again, Tom.
How do parents do it?
Do they have weapons?
You'll understand when the time comes.
You'll understand when the time comes.
I love books.
Tom loves books.
If you want quality, pay for it.
Tom put it in the box.
Tom put it in the box.
I'm not having you boss me around, man.
I'm not having you boss me around, man.
She can't have been in her twenties at that time.
I'll have you know I've been in the business for over a decade.
I can't go on like that.
You're not allowed in here.
You texted me, didn't you?
You texted me, didn't you?
Tell Tom to write me.
What are we gonna do???
Is this why you hired me?
Brother or sister, both are siblings.
I went to the supermarket.
I was at the supermarket.
I don't like the idea of working on the weekends.
I don't like the idea of working on the weekends.
I don't know if you feel the same as I do.
Many trees fell down.
She really likes playing with him.
I know the reason why.
This is the reason why he did it.
This is the reason why he did it.
This is the reason why I came here.
Which word? I asked.
Give me a break!
Tom, you're wanted on the phone.
There's no coffee left.
Do you work together?
Do you work together?
Does that make sense?
Does Tom believe me?
They can open the window.
All was silent in the house.
Have you called an ambulance yet?
I don't want Tom going to your office.
Drink your tea, Tom.
Who else do you miss?
What else do you do?
What else do you do?
How far away is Tom?
They're boys.
I'm not fat.
Who likes war?
People will talk.
Tom agreed to be here at 2:30, but he's not here yet.
She wasn't your sister.
Even Tom doesn't do that.
I can't even look at you.
I'd like to ask a favor.
Tom is playing outside with his son.
When do you need them?
When do you need them?
Even Tom doesn't do that.
You must go back.
You killed my mother.
I'm the doctor.
Have you called an ambulance yet?
My ears hurt.
Our fate is in your hands.
They're going to kill me.
Tom's answer was right.
Must we wait for them here?
Do you two work together?
My sister is also my best friend.
My sister is also my best friend.
Did you just call me your boyfriend?
Every country has its own history.
Do not speak for others.
Do not speak for others.
Her name was Mary.
Drop your guns!
Speak for yourselves.
What are these for?
Where does the sun go at night?
Mary wrote a book about squirrels.
No one speaks that language anymore.
I no longer believe it.
I no longer believe it.
I no longer need it.
I'm no longer sleepy.
What does your name say about you?
Tom was a junkman.
What was it Tom wanted to see?
I won't get in your way.
I take it that means yes.
This box is light.
Tom doesn't know what happened because he wasn't there.
I thought I was never going to see you again.
I thought I was never going to see you again.
I thought I'd never see you again.
I thought I'd never see you again.
My friend was not at home yesterday.
How fast did Tom run?
They were so different.
He liked making decisions.
Living conditions were hard.
They waited in line for the bus.
If you don't want to do it, don't!
If you don't want to do it, don't!
If you don't want to do it, don't!
Tom was taken aback.
Tom said I could stay.
I don't care what you believe.
Please don't make fun of me.
Please don't make fun of me.
Where is he going?
Where is he going?
Where is she going?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
The people demanded answers.
The people demanded answers.
President Wilson was shocked.
This road leads to Hong Kong.
This is the story of my country.
What's the date of the letter?
What's the date of the letter?
Picasso's paintings seem strange to me.
He wants to know the truth.
I gave the boy a book.
I gave the boy a book.
You're the only one who understands me.
You're the only one who understands me.
You're the only one who understands me.
You're the only one who understands me.
How many cats are there in this house?
And who did you learn that from?
And who did you learn that from?
I know why you're here.
I know why you're here.
Suit yourself.
What brought you here?
How do you take your coffee?
How do you take your coffee?
How do you take your coffee?
You have to decide that for yourself.
Wouldn't it be better if I went with you?
What did you say his name was?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
I'll never see you again.
I'll never see you again.
OK, I won't do it again.
We'll never see each other again.
It's been raining again.
I'll never come back here again.
We have plenty to think about.
It's harder than it looks.
Family should always come first.
People are living in all parts of the world.
He opposes me at every turn.
Tom didn't tell us that.
The main street is very broad.
I'm taking the day off.
I've been called worse.
Tell me where to put this.
Tell Tom we're on our way.
That was really something.
Do we have a deal?
You'll feel better in no time.
I was thinking about what you said.
Do you have enough food?
They are making a salad.
She wrote me four letters.
Roosevelt was a war hero.
No one knows the answer.
No one seemed to hear.
No one seemed to hear.
I forgot to ask your name.
I forgot to ask your name.
Why do you like me?
There were no more free seats.
Come as early as possible.
The children were playing in the sunshine.
He was really the man we were looking for.
I'm on my way to a meeting.
That won't happen again.
The book is in the room.
Her work is better than mine.
Are you German?
I will write Judy a letter.
I just didn't have the time.
I know what happened to you.
She said she would be back soon.
Tom says it's time to leave.
Tom must be out of his mind.
I was afraid you'd ask that.
I won't even think about it.
What's Tom doing here?
Tom noticed that.
Give this to us.
I study for 3 hours every day.
I'd like to go.
Tom left the house to his son.
I don't think Tom will agree to do that.
This is the boy who found your watch.
How long should I take this medicine?
I take a shower every morning.
They all look alike.
Are you playing games with me?
Are you playing games with me?
Are you playing games with me?
Can this car go any faster?
I barely have enough money for food.
Mary is my wife.
When do you expect us to do that?
What would the new president do?
The man is liable to the death penalty.
His mother died four years later.
It would be a difficult job.
Thank you all for your attention.
What more can we do?
Leave that to me.
Let me do that.
Let me do that.
I'll kill all of them.
Why weren't you there?
Who are these for?
This day will go down in history.
Come into the room.
Come into the room.
Perhaps she will come tomorrow.
I've been called worse.
Can you help me lift this?
You need a good woman.
Tom is a very tall boy.
No one is listening to us.
Does your wife like cats?
I have seen that girl before.
You had no choice but to do what Tom told you to do.
I'm doing my job.
They'll give us their answer soon.
For personal reasons.
Tell me what you're arguing about.
I think I should've brought more money with me.
It happened one year ago.
I wish God did exist.
What do you know about love?
Why didn't you tell me about this sooner?
There were a fucking lot of them there.
I intend to tell the truth.
I'm going to tell the truth.
That makes more sense.
That makes more sense.
That's why we are here.
Well, well, well, what have we here?
Tom forgot who said it.
Do you still need tea?
Do you still need tea?
Later he wrote to the president.
He is tall and looks strong.
He began to be a problem.
He was in Rome and he didn't see the Pope.
You and I are men.
I don't feel like sleeping right now.
We sat around the campfire.
Tom died in my arms.
It's way too heavy.
It's way too heavy.
I should've stayed.
I thought that my father was going to kill me.
You shouldn't wait here.
You shouldn't wait here.
You shouldn't wait here.
Can you explain this to me?
Can you explain this to me?
Could you explain it to me?
Could you explain it to me?
The wind blew all day.
No one will come.
What could it all mean?
The air became warm.
Can I ask something?
Why should I care what you think?
The man was young.
I shouldn't have slept with her.
Are you afraid of creepy stories?
Sometimes I feel afraid of myself.
Instead of going myself, I sent a letter.
He is putting all his effort into the service of the business.
Tell us what's on your mind.
You start.
You eat.
We have to know what's causing this.
Don't tell me you didn't see it.
I just want to live a normal life.
I just want to live a normal life.
I think Tom is trying to say something.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
I'm going to call an ambulance.
I did my military service in Ankara.
I'm surprised it was that easy.
Are they tall?
It was not until yesterday that I noticed it.
It was not until yesterday that I knew it.
It was not until yesterday that we knew about it.
Tom was really irritated.
We'll get your money back.
She had long hair last year.
What would we do without you?
What would we do without you?
They're right behind me.
They're right behind me.
My friend helped me.
Let's be ready for anything.
What's happening in Italy?
I left it unlocked.
I was young at the time.
I was young at the time.
I didn't feel like cooking.
When did you get up?
I like this school.
The cat which you found is mine.
The cat which you found is mine.
I didn't want to spend my whole life there.
I don't want to spend my whole life here.
I don't know why I'm laughing.
I went to school.
I went to school.
I went to school.
I went to school.
I heard her voice in my sleep.
I heard his voice in my sleep.
I took him to be an honest man.
The boy was admitted to the school.
There isn't anyone here but us.
She is a beautiful girl.
We haven't yet decided where we'll go tomorrow.
Have you been awake all night?
Isaac then asked his father Abraham:
Tom got himself another beer.
If I don't report it, someone else will.
God loves you.
We'll scream.
Why are you asking me that?
You don't even want to think about it.
I just don't want to believe it.
Tom is laughing at you.
She looked me in the eye.
You found something, didn't you?
You found something, didn't you?
You found something, didn't you?
I want this phone.
She asked me whether I liked the plan or not.
I haven't made a decision yet.
You found something, didn't you?
How many times have you eaten at that restaurant? "Too many to remember!"
Tom was sitting under a tree, reading a book.
What did you do then?
The one person I know here is Tom.
You both love each other, don't you?
Don't forget what I just told you.
Don't forget what I just told you.
Where will you put it?
Where will you put it?
Where will you put it?
Where will you put it?
Where will you put it?
Where will you put it?
Where will you put it?
Where will you put it?
Where will you put it?
Where will you put it?
Where will you put it?
Wouldn't you want that?
You don't care, do you?
I give you my word on that.
Tom couldn't kill anyone.
Isn't that mine?
Tom definitely does that.
Tom did everything right.
Tom feels better already.
We go to school together.
We were trying to help Tom.
We'll be there soon enough.
We'll deal with this later.
You know I don't believe you.
You never liked Tom, did you?
You'd better be more careful.
Tom could have paid for Mary's ticket if he'd known she didn't have enough money.
I gave you everything you wanted.
I'd like to see you again.
I'd like to see you again.
I'd like to see you again.
I'd like to see you again.
You're smarter than you look.
Where were you last night?
Please don't call me that.
Please don't call me that.
For me it was a question of life or death.
He and I stayed at the hotel.
You seem to know a lot about it.
Tatoeba is not my wife. You are my wife!
Your family's waiting for you.
I thought a person like you would understand.
I've thought a lot about what you said.
What are you playing at?
What are you playing at?
I enjoy watching children play.
Tom talked about school.
They probably don't know.
Someone tried to kill me.
Why should I leave?
Tom didn't want to leave empty-handed.
I really don't get you.
I really am very tired.
Do what I tell you to do.
Do you think you're ugly?
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
I like both.
I've already been there.
I'm ready as well.
Food's ready!
He doesn't want a relationship. He just wants to sleep with me.
Got it!
It's happening too fast.
What happened this time?
What just happened here?
Tell me what'll happen.
Tell me what'll happen.
Tell me what'll happen.
You were right, Tom.
My friend bought a yellow car.
My friend bought a yellow car.
Twenty dollars are one hundred and forty yuan.
He showed it to me.
He showed it to me.
He's the one who told me about that.
He's the one who told me about that.
Tom wouldn't let us call a doctor.
Where can one buy books?
Where can one buy books?
Either you'll tell the truth or... "Or what? What will happen?"
Don't walk on other people's land.
What did you call me?
What did you call me?
I remember when I first saw you.
I remember when I first saw you.
I've already told Tom what to do.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
They're about to leave.
Do as I told you.
Do it the way I told you to.
Do it the way I told you to.
Do as I say.
Do as I tell you.
I have an appointment with my uncle tomorrow.
That's why I like Tom.
Something was wrong with him.
Something was wrong with her.
Something was wrong with them.
Tom asked me if I had slept well.
I'm not going to wait for her.
I'm not going to wait for him.
I'm not going to wait for them.
I'm not going to wait for you.
I'm not going to wait for you.
We're not going to wait for them.
You go to school.
You go to school.
It's better to be alone.
It's better to be alone.
He was ill, so he couldn't come.
Maybe it wasn't Tom.
He didn't come to school yesterday.
He didn't come to school yesterday.
I'm glad I don't have that problem.
They are exhausted.
I don't care what your mother said.
Everyone knows Mr Hashimoto.
I said Tom didn't do it.
I can't forget her eyes.
I can't forget her eyes.
We were ready.
You weren't ready.
You weren't ready.
Tom wasn't ready for it.
I wasn't ready.
He was ready.
I was ready for it.
I was ready for it.
She called her sister.
She called her sister.
You're ready.
They're finished.
She arrived there before them.
You arrived there before they did.
You arrived there before her.
I went home.
There's no air in this room.
Which one of you two's coming with me?
You can't have both books.
He arrived in a big car.
I'll do better next time.
You ought to be on time if you start now.
The book is mine.
The problem was very difficult.
I'm trying to be fair.
I'm trying to be fair.
Tom isn't back from school yet.
You helped Tom, didn't you?
You helped Tom, didn't you?
You helped Tom, didn't you?
Tom is young at heart.
We're not going to let them die.
What do you believe in?
You have a beautiful name.
I wanted to know why you didn't come yesterday.
It doesn't happen very often.
They read newspapers and books.
I want to know what time to come.
I want you back.
I want you back.
I want you back.
What else can go wrong?
Did you get an answer from them?
Did you get an answer from him?
Did you get an answer from him?
Did you get an answer from him?
Tom isn't alone in this opinion.
It's a special occasion.
Tom isn't on any medication.
We're on top of the situation.
Staying here isn't an option.
You'll be one of us soon.
I want to be a father to your son.
I brought you here for a reason.
Tom knew what he was doing.
We did not get your letter until yesterday.
We did not get your letter until yesterday.
Tom was out of his mind.
Tom was scared to do it.
Can we do it this week?
Tom does that sometimes.
They told me that I would feel a little better if I took this medicine.
Do you think I didn't hear that?
You know I'm not coming back, don't you?
I wanted to come.
You've done this before, I can tell.
You've seen this before, I can tell.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
I will find you a good doctor.
I will find you a good doctor.
I forgot them.
I haven't forgotten you.
I'm afraid you're right.
I did not hear you.
I did not hear you.
I didn't recognize her.
I didn't understand you.
I've forgotten her name.
I don't think you're right.
I have enough money to buy it.
I have enough money to buy it.
Let's ask them.
Let's ask them.
I asked them.
I asked him.
I asked her.
Ask them yourself.
Ask them yourself.
Ask them yourself.
Ask them yourself.
Ask him yourself.
Ask him yourself.
Ask him yourself.
Ask him yourself.
Ask her yourself.
Ask her yourself.
Ask her yourself.
Ask her yourself.
Ask her yourself.
Ask her yourself.
Ask him yourself.
Ask him yourself.
Ask them yourself.
Ask them yourself.
I can imagine how you felt.
I can imagine how you felt.
I can imagine how you felt.
I saw her last week.
I didn't forget you.
I didn't forget you.
Please forgive me for not answering your letter.
I already told you that she isn't here.
I already told you that she isn't here.
Now listen, children.
Is this paper white?
Vanuatu is in Oceania.
Is Tom your son?
I saw my friends yesterday.
We have to do this every day.
Can't you see who it is?
Her eyes were full of sadness.
Their eyes were full of sadness.
Your eyes were full of sadness.
I can't talk about it.
I pretended to work.
You'd have to ask him.
To know is one thing, and quite another to do.
I believe men are basically good.
Tom broke the law.
Imagine yourself to be on the moon.
Show me where it hurts you.
Show me where it hurts you.
Could you help?
Could you help?
I'll pick you up after school.
I'll pick you up after school.
I didn't know what I was doing.
Show me what you have got in your hand.
I didn't realize what I was doing.
Tom says he wasn't here.
They are mine!
We were trying to help her.
We couldn't afford it.
I'd rather stay.
My mother is certain to say no.
It had to be done.
Who's screaming?
Tell Tom I had to leave.
Thank you for this, Tom.
Thanks for your work.
Tom pointed to the sky.
Tom could barely talk.
Tom couldn't sit still.
We should work together.
They don't like to do that.
Today, I bought a book.
Today, I bought a book.
Straighten up.
Step back.
Tom forgot.
They stopped.
They smiled.
He left about 10 minutes ago.
What does Tom want to do tomorrow?
I think I can do it in my spare time.
We named our dog Rex.
Who is responsible for this?
Tell him we'll be ready.
Tell him we'll be ready.
This room is the coldest in the house.
Are those guys your friends?
You've already explained that.
Because she felt sick.
Do you still want to go?
I'm inside the bathroom because I'm washing my hands.
I'd never ask you to do that.
I'd never ask you to do that.
There was only one problem.
Tom died at 65.
It's a pity Tom isn't able to be with us today.
The lesson started at eight o'clock.
We should play by the rules.
She's just trying to get attention.
I almost died when I heard this.
I almost died upon hearing this.
The more one owns, the more one wants.
I don't want you to be here.
She lives across the river.
It is especially difficult for people like me.
Tom, you look very sleepy.
You're feeling very sleepy, aren't you?
I only just noticed it.
I only just noticed it.
I think we have enough time.
Maybe you're not getting enough sleep.
Maybe Tom was walking in his sleep.
Did you get any sleep at all?
You must've been asleep.
Do you know where Tom is going?
Do you know where Tom is going?
Can they really do that?
Maybe they'll come back.
This is yours, isn't it?
You should have told me about the problem sooner.
You should have told me about the problem sooner.
Why would anyone do such a thing?
From time to time, I think about my mother who is no longer living.
Do you think I don't know what's going on?
How did you find out that your brother lived there?
How many boys are in your class?
How many boys are in this class?
He asked her to marry him, and she accepted.
That's hardly likely.
Remember what we spoke about yesterday.
Remember what we spoke about yesterday.
I thought you didn't know that.
I thought you didn't know that.
I do this all the time!
I may not return.
You better run.
There's only one thing I can do.
I was prepared to do anything they asked me to do.
It's not like you knew what they were going to do.
I already know what I'm going to do.
Tom isn't quite ready to do what you're asking him to do.
Tom loves everything you do.
I will go to Ireland this summer.
I think Tom can help us do that.
She saw a tall man yesterday.
I can't spend the whole day just answering your questions.
We could just leave it here.
How could this happen to me?
I don't believe that anyway.
I don't even know your name.
Do you want me to stay here?
Do you want Tom back or not?
That woman knows where I live.
Yes, my child.
We have to make a decision.
We have to make a decision.
I don't remember her name.
Tom took off his muddy shoes.
I like all languages.
It was very hot.
There also was another reason.
Let us know when you'll arrive.
Let us know when you'll arrive.
Let us know when you'll arrive.
Let us know when you'll arrive.
What I was looking for was right before my eyes.
Your hair is too long.
Get them to show you that.
There also was another reason.
Love moves the world.
We were the first to arrive.
We're going to my brother's.
We're not breaking any laws.
Where have you been, anyway?
You aren't serious, are you?
You can go back to work now.
You can't be here right now.
You didn't find it, did you?
You don't live here, do you?
You must've had a nice day.
You seem to like everybody.
You think you're so clever.
What's wrong with this one?
Why did you say that to Tom?
Why did you say that to Tom?
They won't die.
Do you know any of the children in the room?
He looked into her eyes.
Did you kill that man? Yes or no?
Did you kill that man? Yes or no?
Did you kill that man? Yes or no?
Did you kill that man? Yes or no?
Take this medicine twice a day.
I can't remember doing that.
I can't remember doing that.
You had a nosebleed.
Do you have your own room?
How many have you killed?
How many have you killed?
Forget it!
I scarcely believed my eyes.
It wasn't that hard.
I read lips.
I was ready.
Sit down, Kate.
Nothing could stop him.
Nothing could stop her.
This is the best restaurant I know.
This is the best restaurant I know.
I object to you going to Europe alone.
I object to you going to Europe alone.
I object to you going to Europe alone.
I object to you going to Europe alone.
I object to you going to Europe alone.
I know everybody here.
Interlingua has five older sisters.
I need coffee.
I'm afraid we won't be able to help you tomorrow.
I'm afraid we won't be able to help you tomorrow.
I can't leave now.
Why don't you let him decide?
Is the place clean?
Can I sit on your lap?
That was our plan.
After a while he found out the answer.
After a while he found out the answer.
That's exactly what I'd say.
If only I'd known then what I know now.
I heard someone come into the room.
It is true that I was head over heels in love with her.
No body is perfect.
It happened on the first of May.

If you can kill your enemy, do it, if not, make him your friend.
You're taller than I am.
Tom opened one of the bottles.
You're not just my wife. You're my best friend.
Listen, everybody!
Are these my socks or yours?
My wife is three years younger than I am.
The problem is that that boy never does what he is told to do.

You don't know what I was going to do.
Tom didn't go to school.
I don't think Tom understood.

Which is easier, this book or that book?
I'll come if you want me to.
She really takes after her mother.

Tom isn't the only one who thinks so.
I've said enough.
Tom died in October.
Where did you put my book?
Tom is your boyfriend?
I want to see you as soon as possible.
I have to say this.
You'd better take this.
Tom doesn't want me to see what he's doing.
I knew I shouldn't have done that.
Tom is only a couple of years older than me.
Don't you have any beer?
They're different.
What did Tom need?
Tom comes here almost every weekend.
Everyone wants that.
No one wants that.
I got that from Tom.
Tom is too far away to hear us.
Do you still need me?

Times were hard.
Tom thought about it.
Thank you for the article.
Thanks for your response.

Tom, you should see this.
Nobody said a thing.
People are still scared.
Tom agreed.

The rules are simple.
We really are hungry.
I didn't see a soul.
You're the only friend I have.
Tom has gone back to Australia.
Hasn't Tom returned yet?
Tom must return home.
The pain returned.
Here are the results.
Isn't Tom your brother?
Tom knew about that already.
Most important is that you think for yourself.
Write your goals down on a sheet of paper.
Never ever do it like this again.
I really like this restaurant.
I just wanted to hear your voice.
I just wanted to hear your voice.
I opened one.
The boy sat among the girls.
Because it's too big.
That remains a mystery.
Haven't I told you this before?
Relationships are hard work.
Nobody will recognize you.
Nobody will recognize you.
The reasons are understandable.
That's understandable.
It was understandable.
What would you propose?
It was rainy that day.
Where else could that happen?
We have a special connection.
Tom has done so much already.
Tom didn't understand at all.
Tom could've killed somebody.

Tom still lives there.
No one listened.
Tom, are you listening?
They have bread.
I've never felt so good in my life.
Nobody was listening to what Tom was saying.
Nobody likes that.
Kids like to play.
My father is in his room.
How long has Tom been standing there?
We like our apartment.
Look to your left.

We have almost no water left.
This is our land.

I'm the best.
How much time do I have left?
She talked about Paris as if she had been there many times.

What's the question?
I do think so.

Shouldn't we help them?
That's the best thing that could happen to me.
I'd like to return to Tokyo via Honolulu.
It was my first job.
I want to become a doctor in the future.
What else do you plan to do?
What else do you plan to do?
This road goes to the city.
How is Tom going to help you?
She gave us lots to eat.
We will help him if he asks us.
There are a lot of different peoples in the world.
Tom said he'd be right back.
He never said that.
It's part of the game.
I think the box is empty.
Call the fire department!
I play with the PlayStation 3.
Do you see her often?
Do you see her often?
However hard I try, I can't do it any better than she can.
The boy kept standing for a while.
Why didn't you return?

Why didn't you return?
When are you coming to Melbourne again?

Be a little more careful next time.
If he comes, I'll go too.
Is Tom going to get his money back?
Is Tom going to get his money back?
What is our problem?
What is our problem?
You must not speak loudly.
The town was exactly the same as before.
I'm certainly not your friend.
She decided to go.
She owes me money.
She uncrossed her legs.
My house is far away.
They needed help.
We'd like to help.
We offered to help.
Tom offered to help.
Those kids need our help.
They offered to help us.
What was Tom eating?
We are staying at home because it's raining.
I want you to forget everything you saw today.
I just want to be Tom's friend.
It may never happen.
How can that happen?
I saw that happen.
It had to happen.
That hasn't happened.
That happens in life.
Sometimes that happens.
Nobody saw what happened.
What happened that day?
Isn't she beautiful?
What did she mean?
That happens to everyone.
That happened in October.
That has already happened.
That almost happened to me, too.
Tom wanted to know what was happening.
We told everyone about what had happened.
A strange thing happened to me yesterday.
We weren’t prepared for what happened.
Where will Tom go?
Where will Tom go?
Tom wanted to go.
Nobody went home.
Let's go, Tom.
Go see for yourself.
Go see for yourself.
Let's all go to Tom's.
Everybody wants to go.
Everyone may go home.
Everyone must go home.
Will they go together?
Will they go together?
Nobody knew where Tom went.
If Tom goes, I'll go with him.
If Tom goes, I'll go with him.
The pain still hasn't gone away.
Give me your watch.
Give me the phone.
Give me your watch.
Give me the phone.
Those who want to stay can stay.
I write letters to my friends.
Isn't she a doctor?
Tom wrote three letters.
It's 4:30 in the afternoon.
When will she return home?
Does she always go there?
I think you should speak a bit more slowly.
Even a child could do it.
What book are you reading?
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
None of us did what Tom wanted us to do.
I have never thought of that.
My wife loves cats.
You will always be welcome whenever you come.
Someone told me about that.
Please give me the menu.
What is the meaning of my life?
No women would buy that.
They are working this weekend.
I'm sorry, I didn't know where else to go.
That happened in 2013.
I want to stay home.
You forgot his name.
I don't think they're coming.
Tom stayed at home.
Please forgive my son.
I understand what happened.
Just tell me her name.
Tom isn't sick anymore.
Tom didn't want to go to school.
I don't think I can do this alone.
Tom suddenly realized he wasn't alone.
Jim likes the doctor.
You may die.
You may die.
I don't want Tom to be a soldier.
Do you remember what happened to you?
Tell me what has become of him.
You had better not speak loudly in this room.
We both know what you're doing.
It's a huge problem.
Our air is polluted.
Don't make fun of that child.
Get back, get back!
She gave me several books.
He gave me some books.
We believe in ourselves.
Mark took the book.
God is bad.
I just told Tom the truth.
What will happen will happen.
There are conditions.
No, I haven't written it yet.
Do you really want me to do this?
Do you really want me to do this?
We didn't see any signs.
I think you'd better sit down.
I think you'd better sit down.
Are you afraid to go home?
Tom told me that he'd like to become a doctor.
Tom usually does what he says he'll do.
No weapon was found.
Were any weapons found?
His girlfriend did it for him.
In case you want, I will do it.
It depends on what you mean.
It depends on what you mean.
They consider him intelligent.
Maybe Tom is trying to tell me something.
You're old friends, aren't you?
You're old friends, aren't you?
Tom finally understood why.
Tom finally understood it.
They offered the job to me.
Where did she buy a book?
I have to live.
Tom didn't tell me what time I should come tomorrow.
I think I know what Tom is doing.
Tom didn't give me the money I asked for.
Can you speak my language?
Tom has enough problems the way it is.
That's just the way it's got to be.
I understand their feelings.
The supermarket shelves were almost empty.
The restaurant was empty.
Tom eats almost anything.
What exactly did you say to Tom?
Has Tom quit drinking?
Tell me what you gave Tom.
We don't want people like Tom in our club.
She didn't recognize me.
She was my only friend.
I did say that.
Can I do this?
Can I do this?
We did our jobs.
We did it again.
Can they do this?
What must you do?
What must you do?
What must you do?
I don't want to listen to you.
What must you do?
Did that happen here?
What do you want to see?
What did Tom do next?
Nobody here does that.
No one else can do it.
No one else can do it.
How is everybody doing?
Tom doesn't know that yet.
Tom doesn't know that yet.
Someone's gotta do it.
I didn't have much time.
You've already done enough.
I thought she was sick.
How did she find out about that?
And what was her answer?
She lives beyond her means.
I know she'll agree.
I'll never be able to play again.
Which way did she go?
She never wrote him back.
She never wrote him back.
She never wrote him back.
We shouldn't be seen together.
I would love to see my old flame again.
We did everything right.
When and where exactly did you buy that?
When and where exactly did you buy that?
When and where exactly did you buy that?
She doesn't know what's going on.
I work simply because I like to work.
I work simply because I like to work.
They brought medical supplies.
I have a question to ask all of you.
Who did Tom do that for?
I work simply because I like to work.
I didn't have much money.
I didn't have much water.
Tom blamed himself for what happened.
Because they're eating dinner.
Do you actually believe this?
Today was a very tough day.
Should I help Tom do that?
Tom didn't even look at me.
They do everything together.
That usually doesn't happen.
Everybody is doing something.
Please don't do that anymore.
Please don't do that anymore.
How much food do we have left?
I can hardly understand what she says.
It was pretty easy to do that.
I can hardly understand what she says.
How much water do we have left?
How much money do we have left?
What's Tom doing this weekend?
Fortunately, that didn't happen.
Fortunately, that didn't happen.
As you know, that didn't happen.
Maybe Tom has already done that.
We were shocked by what Tom did.
We don't have this in Australia.
Tom doesn't need any more money.
I'm capable of doing that myself.
I didn't think this would happen.
I didn't think this would happen.
What do I need to know?
What's so strange about that?
They don't do it.
He will return to Japan some day.
The trouble is that there is little water left.
Tom told me he was going to kill you.
I don't believe she would understand it.
Tom is pretty smart, isn't he?
Tom is pretty smart, isn't he?
She opened the window, even though I told her not to.
By registered letter?
I absolutely don't know that woman.
What did Father say about it?
Give us a second.
The girl wanted to, but could not, tell him the truth.
Where's Mark? He's having a shower.
That really does happen sometimes.
I don't go there so often anymore.
They made the decision.
Tom was there, but he didn't help us.
He gave money to each of his sons.
I don't remember where I put my glasses.
Tom told me that my hair was too long.
If Tom had asked me for help, I would've helped him.
I live in this place.
He heard footsteps.
Where did you eat them?
I had completely forgotten to do that.
Are you going to town today?
Would you do that again if you had the chance?
Would you do that again if you had the chance?
I couldn't help you even if I wanted to.
I couldn't help you even if I wanted to.
You have to believe in yourself.
I can't do what you're asking me to do.
I can't do what you're asking me to do.
What do you mean, Tom?
Tom looked at them both.
Tom looked at them both.
Tom looked at the menu.
Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Don't you understand what I'm trying to tell you?
Don't you understand what I'm trying to tell you?
Tom died Monday.
Everybody will die.
Both soldiers died.
All of them died.
She's just like you.
Tom is just like you.
Tom found what he was looking for under the table.
I thought somebody died.
I thought somebody died.
Nobody should've died.
My brother has died.
Your mother died yesterday.
Your mother died yesterday.
Tom died almost immediately.
We've already decided.
I had a fender bender on my way to work.
In fact, he too loved her.
I've just been to the post office to buy some stamps.
You should've told me you didn't know what to do.
Every man cannot be a hero.
This boy is my son.
Do like I said, OK?
Tell Tom I won't do that.
Tell Tom I won't do that.
What's happened to the light?
My father died when I was seven.
He asked me if I know her phone number.
He asked if I like mathematics.
He asked if I like mathematics.
Tom wouldn't even speak to me.
He lay awake for hours thinking about her.
Everything that could go wrong, went wrong.
He has never been heard of since.
Everyone was sitting cross-legged on the floor.
What could we do?
I couldn't be a doctor.
We couldn't stop them.
I usually eat less than my boyfriend.
They couldn't be stopped.
You could've told me the truth.
You could've told me the truth.
I would stay here with you if I could.
I would stay here with you if I could.
Black looks good on you.
Black looks good on you.

Jim is taller than any of his friends.
That would cost a lot of money.
I don't know when she will arrive.
I don't know when he will arrive.
I don't know when I will arrive.
They tried to kill me.
Don't try to help me.
Don't try to help me.
Is that book for me?
I'll never forget what you've done for me.
I'll never forget what you've done for me.
I'll never forget what you've done for me.
Tom has done so much for me.
Nobody believed me.
Tom stood behind me.
Tom always smiles at me.
You still haven't answered me.
You still haven't answered me.
I know how I can do it.
We're so happy for you.
We're so happy for you.
Finally!
This money is mine.
Tom will be back any minute.
Why do you need money?
Why do you need money?
Why do you need money?
Why do you need money?
Tom took all my money.
Nobody's asking you for money.
Nobody's asking you for money.
Tom has been waiting for you all morning.
Tom has been waiting for you all morning.
Tom is always on the move.
Why don't you want to tell us the truth?
That's happened to a lot of us.
Tom isn't the one who gave me this money.
I haven't seen my sister for years.
I haven't seen my sister for years.
I was trying to kill them.
I don't know what I mean.
We know they'll come.
They want to come.
Nobody ever comes here.
Tom and I are the only ones still here.
They don't have to come if they don't want to.
Some people came by car. Others came by bus.
You were with me on that night.
You were with me on that night.
You were with me on that night.
Another war, and we all will be killed.
She cried for help, but nobody heard her.
The road was clear.
Is there a lot left to do?
You're on the right track.
Can you speak a language other than English?
Do you have another plan?
Do you have another plan?
What was she doing in your room?
What was she doing in your room?
Their view of life may appear strange.
Tom is my destiny.
I saw him at the restaurant.
I consider myself a clever man.
I still don't know, even now.
Isn't that what we should be doing?
Tom is asking how that's possible.
I just spoke with the captain.
He believes you.
I've got to study.
Did you stop at the red traffic light?
I knew about that a week ago.
I knew about that a week ago.
He's intimidated by beautiful women.
She is not only pretty, but also kind.
There will be other opportunities.
There will be other opportunities.
He needs that money.
I told them about that yesterday.
I told them about it yesterday.
What's past is past.
What's past is past.
Why should I give you money?
Why should I give you money?
Why should I give you money?
Why should I give you money?
You must do as he says.

Germans are perfectionists.
Today I had soup for dinner.

I write letters almost every day.
Dan is finally here.
I told you that I wasn't ready.
I told you that I wasn't ready.
I really do like you a lot.
The boys in the village laughed at me.
We're different.
People should be the masters of their own destinies.
Thanks, everyone.
It was delicious.
It was delicious.
Why learn Klingon?
The girls giggled.
What about boys?
He never came.
This river is the widest in Europe.
What are you doing in a place like this?
What are you doing in a place like this?
Would you please come with me?
I can't understand what he is thinking about.
This street is dark.
I wish I could help you, but I can't stay any longer.
We always work together.
Why are you screaming?!
I think she is the kindest woman on earth.
Tom wanted to see what would happen.
I didn't like my first job.
What sort of person are you?
I really love her.
I really love her.
Who's the guy Tom is talking to?
Mother was afraid I would get dirty.
A cat has seven lives.
It is the time you should be at work, isn't it?
Tom told me everything that happened.
You cannot live by love alone.
The Second World War was not yet over.
We're going to make this work.
She felt bad.
Is everybody ready? Let's make a start.
Could you help me find my dog?
My husband didn't die.
I don't need your help, but you need mine.
He had no particular reason to go there.
If I don't tell her, who will?
If I don't tell her, who will?
Tom said that he wanted to forget her.
Let them know.
I know what's happened to him.
The wine was red.
Tom decided not to answer the question.
It's a pity that he had died so young.
No, Laurie isn't fat.
OK, let's just do it.
Is this my seat or yours?
Is this my seat or yours?
Now I'm definitely not going to sleep.
Wasn't he your boyfriend?
The majority of what Dan is saying is correct.
Are your wife and children here?
I remember seeing her once on the street.
Only a few people listened to him.
I knew what the Jacksons were doing.
I knew what the Jacksons were doing.
I told you Tom would understand.
I told you Tom would understand.
We should inform them about that.
nous restons.
We're strong.
Should we continue?
We need heroes.
We have to escape.
Should we start?
We worked together.
We both want it.
We both want it.
We have a plan.
We're deluding ourselves.
I never learned his real name.
I sometimes still think about her.
What exactly did you say?
I told them I'd think about it.
I told them I'd think about it.
I told them I'd think about it.
What else can you do?
You must do as I say.
Shouldn't we help him?
They're the best of friends now.
Is today really Monday?
Is today really Monday?
You have no right to do that.
I don't believe her.
I don't believe her.
She did not agree with him.
Raise your hand when I call your name.
We should follow him.
I'm coming for her.
We expect him to come back soon.
I don't know how she finds the time.
I don't know how he finds the time.
I'm not sure what Tom meant by that.
I'm not sure what he meant by that.
I'm not sure what she meant by that.
I cannot start till six o'clock.

Think about how you'd feel if that happened to you.
Think about how you'd feel if that happened to you.

Do not beat around the bush; we have a problem, don't we?
They all want to know what happened.
Perhaps Tom needs help.

Tom looked at his hands.
Tom did it again.
How can we do that?
Did they come today?
There's no blood on the floor.
Tom took me to a restaurant where you can eat as much as you want for thirty dollars.

Tom will be able to answer your question.
Tom can't have written this by himself.
Everything happened too fast.
Tom is playing with his yo-yo.
Do you know who that person is?
The sun is in the sky.
What a sweet little girl you are!
Please understand my position.
How should I eat this?
Tom always wears black clothes.

You should've listened to us.
You should've listened to us.
Tom can't come to work today because he doesn't feel well.

You're part of my life.
You've become a beautiful woman.
What would Tom say?
Tom reads lots of books.
Now you've hurt my feelings.
I really like that feeling.
They're clean.
Action!
And then everyone started laughing.
I can't face the truth.
Tom failed to understand that.
For my friends, everything; for my enemies, the law.
What does this machine do?
You've got a lot of problems, don't you?
You've got a lot of problems, don't you?
Tom was old.
I couldn't answer.

You'll be fine now.
Tom says he will never go there again.
We need them.
Thank you for doing the cooking while I was sick in bed.
Give people what they want.

Tom goes there three times a week.
How are you doing, Mike? "My name is Tom."
Where's Tom? "I don't know. He should have been here ten minutes ago."
He should've been here ten minutes ago.
Take mine.
Take mine.
Take mine.

That would mean a lot to me.
I wish Tom were here right now instead of me.

Your French is good enough.
I will never do it again.
Could you please move out of my way?
Do you think it'll fit?
Tom took a seat.
Tom is afraid to go outside.
Everybody's ready to go.
Everybody's ready to go.
You'd better go without me.
I didn't understand the meaning.
Things are going too fast.
We know you're sick.
We know you're sick.
Tom would help us, wouldn't he?

What did Tom write?
I think Tom will go there tomorrow.
The restaurant is empty.
Are you still in school?
Are you still in school?
Is this even possible?
Tom will be back tomorrow.
My car is older than me.
Someone's gotta do it.
Someone has to do it.
Let's start with this.
Don't blame yourself. It's my fault.
They're trying.
Do you know my son?
Do you know my son?
That's exactly what we want.

Did you do this all yourself?
I have to do it today.
Tom can do it.

If you don't understand, please raise your hand.
If you had wanted our help, why didn't you ask us for it?
What a beautiful view.
Any one of us could do it.
None of us want that.
Could you leave us alone?
Could you leave us alone?
I saw them leave together.
Tom would've made the same decision I'm making if he were in my shoes.
That's a lot to consider.
I don't think I could live without you.
That's a lot to consider.
We can open the windows.
What does Tom know about this?
Do you want me to help you with that?
I know my job.
This isn't a very good company.
That's your problem, not mine.
I almost did it.
She has about 2,000 books.
Did Tom say who did it?
Give Tom the $300.
Give Tom the $300.
You can't leave us here.
You can't leave us here.
You can't leave us here.
Be more flexible.
It's your turn.
Tom walks quickly.
There were no flowers or trees on his street.
Tom will never agree to that.
That's a lot to consider.
I'm inclined to agree.
Tom currently lives with his uncle.
Do you have trouble sleeping?
Just do what you can.
Am I still your boyfriend?
Don't you remember me?
Would you like to stay for dinner?
Would you like to stay for dinner?

Tom often eats in bed.
You're sick, aren't you?
You're sick, aren't you?
Tom said he'd come.
I want to do more.
He hasn't returned yet.
That was a nice hotel.
I've got plans.
No, Tom, don't do that.
I know you want answers.
Why don't you believe us?
Tom took off his socks and shoes and walked into the sea.
He went to London in 1970.
Just take one.
Tom wasn't his usual self today.
What's all the commotion about anyway?
I think you should think about the future.
I think you should think about the future.
Where is this guy going?
You're odd.
She isn't afraid of snakes.
Should we stay or should we go?
Tom was sitting on the table.
You can sit wherever you want.
You can sit wherever you want.
You can sit wherever you want.
If you want to sit down, sit down.
If you want to sit down, sit down.
How long have you been sitting here?
How long have you been sitting here?
He knows me better than I know myself.
He knows me better than I know myself.
Tom stood up, but then sat down again.
He introduced his sister to me.
She had less free time than I.
Tom came into the restaurant and sat at his usual table.
It only happened once.
Tom stared at his hands.
I heard you were back.
I heard you were back.
I heard you were back.
I heard you were back.
Tell me about those.
Tom said that he would come tomorrow.
Tom came last week.
We shouldn't be doing this.
You've got company.
Tom just got a new job.
Why did you come back here?
Why did you come back here?
Why did you come back here?
Why did you come back here?
Why did you come back here?
Why did you come back here?
I know that I was wrong.
Where exactly are we going?
They both smiled.
You haven't told me your name.
Your sister's sleeping.
Tom will take the bus.
Forget I said that.
Forget I said that.
Forget I said that.
Forget I said that.
Can you show me another room?
I was trying to forget everything.
Nothing makes any sense.
Tom is never coming home again, is he?
Can you please not do that right now?
It was a good day.
It was a good day.
Do you still want this?
What job did they offer you?
Tom understands our system.
Tom is a slow eater.
That's all we can do.
We have a relationship.
They call me captain.
I think that you should go.
Ask my friends.
I'll get a second job.
We both saw you.
This is why I don't have a boyfriend.
Here's your tea, Tom.
I can't feel my legs.
I think that you should go.
Tom eventually agreed.
I'm not afraid of you.
You've got to work together.
Think about your goals.
Keep this.
Keep this.
Who's responsible for this problem?
I can't go even if I want to.
Who's responsible for this problem?
I do not know what you mean.
These aren't just any 3-D glasses.
Let's ask her when she gets back home.
I wish everyone would just go away.
Do you think that'll happen soon?
Who wants to kill you?
I have no feelings.
Do you want me to answer?
Let's all help Tom.
Tom doesn't go to school anymore.

It often rains here.
This is a huge house.
My arms are tired.
We made...
I'll go and get help.
He has his reasons for staying there.
You've done enough.
Everybody was waiting the same fate - death.
I'm on good terms with her.
Do they really exist?
My little daughter likes to sit on my shoulders.
The old man's house is further up the road.
Tom didn't buy bread.
You didn't have to ask.

She felt very bad that day.
Call an ambulance!
Open your heart.

I can drive myself.
You should go hang out with your friends.
Stand up!
You can't handle the truth.
I couldn't go with you even if I wanted to.
The average woman is taller than me.
May I come again?
May I come again?
Tom forgot the rules.
I don't want to be the person who tells Tom that.
It's going to be a while until Tom gets here.
This window is bulletproof.
There's something going on here.
Is that going to happen soon?
How long have you been waiting?
Tom was very sleepy.
Did Tom find the person he was looking for?
Tom was ready for anything.
She must have been sick.
My name sounds strange.
This paper is white.

Don't toy with me, Tom.
Did you have other plans?
Did you have other plans?
I didn't have to pay.
We have had a lot of rain this summer.
Tom isn't able to do it.
We'll be back as soon as possible.
You're afraid that I'm right, aren't you?
That's why I came to you.
That's why I came to you.
Are you going help me?
What exactly do you do here?
What did you forget?
Don't leave without telling me.
I've got things under control now.
They're both empty.
They're both empty.
You're just like the others.
You're just like the others.
That's not what I wanted to show you.
This just doesn't make sense.
Tom can't go home now.
Why are you yelling at me?
Why are you yelling at me?
Why are you yelling at me?
Why are you yelling at me?
I really like your work.
I really like your work.
I really like your work.
I'd like to come with you.
I know those girls.

We'll think about that.
Don't believe everything that you hear.
Just tell me where to go.
Just tell me where to go.
We'll have to come back.
Tom didn't even know what to do.
Tell me it's true.
Tom is a little crazy.
What exactly was Tom doing?
When did you hear about it?
When did you hear about it?
Tom will never come here again.
I'm afraid Tom doesn't want to talk to you.
Please don't shout.
Can we do it before Monday?
There was no pain.
That girl resembles her mother.
I'll show you how it works.
I'll show you how it works.
I know you can do this.
I know you can do this.
I don't think Tom will notice.
I don't think Tom will notice.
Tom stood up and walked to the window.
By this time tomorrow, we will have already arrived.
I was humiliated.
I was humiliated.
Tom is doing a good job.
Tom has tricked us.
Tom went there instead of me.
I'll explain afterwards.
I think I remember how to do that.
Who wants to go next?
You'll have to leave.
You'll have to leave.
We're all different.
Show me how you did it.
I would never do it again.
Tom hasn't answered my letter yet.
Tom always keeps his word.
Tom has found a solution.
That seems right.
Tom returned to work.
Tom remained outside.
I saw Tom leave.
Tom isn't your enemy.

That was our job.
You have no idea how pretty the girls are around here!
The airplane is ready.
Why didn't you come to me?
Why didn't you come to me?
Tom became a hero in his hometown.
She read my mind.
I looked her straight in the eye.
It's the only thing I can do.
I really tried.
Will you be my Valentine?
What would Tom say if he walked in right now?
It was lucky for you that you found it.
It was lucky for you that you found it.
Do you have any plans for Saturday?
If you want to know, why don't you ask him?
We won't be fooled again.
Raise your right hand.
Did I really do that?
Are you going to watch?
Are you going to watch?
He is the love of my life.
She is the love of my life.
He was the love of her life.
She often said that he was the love of her life.
She was the love of his life.
Why do you need me?
Introduce me to your friend Peter.
Introduce me to your friend Peter.
Drive slowly.
I'm not sure what's wrong with him.
I'm not sure what's wrong with her.
Is the coast clear?
Is the sun up?
Is the sun up yet?
Tom asked why I did it.
You're all alone.
You're all alone.
You're all alone.
You're all alone.
You're all alone.
Tom is the fattest person I know.
You should help Tom.

Stand where you are or I'll kill you.
This car is in good condition.
Who stayed?
Tom stayed.
Just go away.
It'll be over soon.
I can't wait to see you.
I could barely speak.
John does not want to answer the question.
John will not answer the question.
Maybe later.
I won't leave without you.

Your hair's beautiful.
Should I go?
The whole country is talking about it.
Why are you still up? You should get to bed.
Can I go buy some ice cream?
Tom said you wouldn't go.
Tom said you wouldn't go.
What a strange guy!
It is your right.
It is your right.
You're the only friend I have.
I've heard that many times.
Where did I put it?

Someone was here.
I had this illness before.

If you did that for me, it would help a lot.

Tom is just trying to help.
Anything you remember might help.
Tom's the best.
It's the same old problem.
That's what they pay me for.
There were about a thousand people.
Tom says he needs help.
They say they need help.
We're ready to help you.
We're ready to help you.
Thanks for your help, Tom.
Help is already on the way.
I know what Tom is doing here.
Tom tried to help us.
I know what that smell is.
How are you feeling tonight?
Tom used to be my boyfriend.
I knew what you meant.
I knew what you meant.
I don't think Tom understands what's going on.
Who did you give that to?
The question isn't as easy to answer as it first might seem.
Her teeth were white.
I think she's too young.
How old is this tree?
I will do what you say.
She had a good time.
How did you do it?
He had a good time.
Her teeth were white.
His teeth were white.
You'd better not go there.
You'd better not go there.
Does your mom know?
She says that she can see through walls.
I can't see through walls.
That's becoming a problem.
She's playing Super Mario Bros.
You have to help me.
I'll get back to you.
My ass!
I wasn't the one who wrote this.
I have to tell Tom about it.
I have to tell Tom about it.
Tell me what's going on.

Sorry, I don't follow.
I'll give you this money.
Those are my children.

We'll never go back there again.
Has the bell rung yet?
Everyone thinks I'm weird.
Everyone thinks I'm weird.
I don't think you're telling the truth.
They went together.
I want to spend all my life with you.
She knows what she's talking about.
Who wrote this book? "John did."
These books are very precious to us.
Let me die.
You're wrong.
Do you work on Sundays?
Do you work on Sundays?
Are we starting soon?
We stayed at our uncle's.
Tom has been warned more than once.
I've already talked about that more than once.
They have to come.
Nothing is wrong with you. It's not your fault.
What exactly do you want from me?
Tom stood up slowly.
Tom wants to know your name.
Tom also smiled.
I don't think Tom will come.
It was time to leave.
It was time to go.
Tom works on Sundays.
I'm rooting for you.
I simply have to know.
Well, what am I going to do?
Do you know this game?
What happened to your voice?
I don't care if he has twenty girlfriends.
Do you want to know who I really am?
Are you ill?
I thought it might be you.
I thought it might be you.

I thought it might be you.
I thought it might be you.
I thought it might be you.
I thought it might be you.
Yes, I understand. Thanks a lot.
Look at him.
I just smiled.
I don't think you'd understand.
I want to be able to speak Russian fluently.
They read her book.
You recognize her, don't you?
I still love him.
Put your hand on my shoulder.
Put your hand on my shoulder.
What did Tom ask you to do?

I don't really understand what just happened.
Put the box wherever you can find room for it, please.
The mother told the children to be quiet.
You have blood on your hands.
You have blood on your hands.

Do you want to tell me what happened?
When will you come?
When are you going to come?

You remember her, don't you?
You remember her, don't you?
I've forgotten your number.
I forgot his phone number.
Did you forget something?
These blinds are not made of real wood.
I'm writing to him.
I don't want to be like that.
May I borrow your bike?
He put his hand on my knee under the table.
The field was full of lavender flowers.
They play together a lot.
I told Tom I wouldn't do what he asked me to do.
Who's the strongest kid?
Why didn't Tom listen?
Please stay for dinner.

Has Tom done something wrong?
That's what we're doing now.
I want to know your telephone number.
What should I do in the meantime?
Tom is sitting beneath the tree.
I saw the red light.
Tom looked at the floor.

What does that have to do with anything?
What does that have to do with anything?
Tom liked his job very much.
Tom will return home tomorrow.
Tom could've come with me.
Tom is way off the mark.
You should be in bed.
What are the conditions?
Why I didn't think of that?
What does Tom mean?
I am willing to help you.
I am willing to help you.
You're wide of the mark.
I am willing to help you.
Take another step forward.
Tom helped again.
I don't think that'll happen.
I don't think it's going to happen.
My leg is still hurting.

I'd like to know what's happening here.
What did she do with all the money?
Tom is at his desk writing something.
This isn't enough.
Would you really do that for me?
Tom did as he was told.
Tom removed his jacket.
I'm glad you replied.

Having finished the work, he went home.
You can't sit with me.
You can sit with me.
You can sit next to me.

The boys played softball.
I still believe it.

How much will I receive?
Girls like to play house.

She knows what she's doing.
They spoke too quickly for me to understand.
She was outraged.
I can't imagine my life without her.
She's playing with her friends.
How long did it take for you to read this book?
I don't know where I'm going.
I want you to go home.
Do you know this girl?

He makes me feel appreciated and loved.

He did not agree.
I never leave home without it.

Do you have a significant other?
Do what you want with it.

She was there last summer.
I don't think he cares.
I don't think he cared.
I don't think she cares.
I don't think she cared.
I know Tom was there.
She doesn't look like her mom.
His parents were out of town.
Neither was true.
She knew what she was doing was wrong, but she still did it.

How exactly did that happen?
Do you work at all?
What do you think of the book?
She has a a tidy apartment.
I want to declutter my apartment.
Why doesn't she play with me anymore?
Why doesn't he play with me anymore?
Do you prefer green or black tea?
I still love her.
We are writing.
Why doesn't he write me anymore?
Why doesn't he write me back anymore?
We'll never know the reason.
One minute he was here, the next he was gone.
One minute she was here, the next she was gone.
Won't you tell me?
Won't you tell me?
Her hair was a mess.
He was supposed to be here.
Your question is illogical.
It was three in the morning.
I wish I could spend more time with my family.
What are you doing this summer?
Tom had no idea what the woman was talking about.
He had no idea what she was talking about.
She doesn't have any problems at school.
The squirrel ate out of her hand.

Don't respond.

What's the connection?
The second lesson is very easy.
I'm very glad about that.
I was working that night.
My parents are not home.
We're on the right track.
I think we're on the right track.
I think you're on the right track.
I think you're on the right track.
I told Tom never to do that again.
I used to wear glasses.

I remained where I was.
I remained where I was.
I like school.
I look like my father.

I wrote a book, but it wasn't very good.
I have the same question.
I can't talk about that.
I can't talk about this.
I have a simple solution.
She explained the matter to me.
If this is the best of all possible worlds, what are the others like?
Stay in the car.
Stay in the car.
Stay in the car.
Don't ever do that.
She's very good at her job.
He's good at his job.
It's the only thing you can do.
Who could have imagined that?
He must have told her.
All eyes turned towards her.
All eyes turned towards him.
Her voice faded with each word.
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.
She blamed it on me.
It never made much sense to me anyway.
It could fall into the wrong hands.
It could fall into the wrong hands.
She died less then a year later.
She died less then a year later.
What if something happened to her?
What if something happened to him?
That's only half the story.
Where is the school?
He stared at his feet.
She stared at her feet.
Drink plenty of water.
She's my half-sister, but I call her my sister.
Will you keep the baby?
What was all that about?
I know what you think, but she's not like that.
We'll do it some other time.
I've always wanted to ask you something.
There are many varieties of potato dumplings in Bavaria.
Stop calling me that!
You shouldn't eat just before you go to bed.
Write an answer.
Tom didn't say where he wanted to go.
Why not just call the police?
I barely know him at all.
I barely know her at all.
I hardly know him.
It's cheap, but the quality isn't that good.
It's cheap, but the quality isn't that good.
It's cheap, but the quality isn't that good.
I hardly know her.
Tom tried not to smile.
Tom is a doctor now.
Tom is already at his desk.
I'm afraid to even ask.
For once in your life, do what I ask.
For once in your life, do what I ask.
It's cheap, but the quality isn't that good.
Tom was sitting behind me.
They aren't mine.
These are my best friends.
Have you written the letter? "No, I'm writing it now."
That seems inhumane to me.
I always think about it.
I wish I'd thought of that.
I thought it was possible.
I thought about my family.
I've already written to Tom.
I'm named after my father.
They were laughing at me.
Haven't you been listening?
Haven't you been listening?
Are you going to die?
What did you do with that?
What did you do with that?
This stone was so heavy that I could not lift it.
I don't know if we want to do that.
This is a friend of mine.
I'm not thinking about it.
I gave her my word I would be back home by nine.
Who was here yesterday?
Did I tell you that already?
Did I tell you that already?
I had some time to think.
Do you like to live in the country?
She has never seen the sea.
What else does Tom do?
Tom was the last one to arrive here.
I think I'd want to know.
I think I'd want to know.
That happened last week.
I haven't showered in three days.
Can you call me a taxi?
I think everybody is ready.
I think about it sometimes.
Tom almost always has on sunglasses.
He started again.
I'd like to tell you the truth.
I'd like to tell you the truth.
We won't let you pass away.
We won't let you die.
You aren't allowed to go into that room.
You aren't allowed to go into that room.
Who's Tatoeba? Your new girlfriend?
What time did you eat?
Tom sat down beside her.
There are a few houses around.
Tom had no idea that I'd be here.
Of course, Tom loves his kids.
What rotten luck!
He is not my father, he is my uncle.
I said no!
Tom was the last one to arrive here.
Tom does what is asked of him.
Tom asked, what is happening to me.
If Tom didn't want to be here, he would not have come.
Tom had no idea that I would be here.
Please come next Friday.
Does anybody really care?
Another man has died.
Tom is writing at his desk.
Tom is writing at his desk.
They stopped three minutes later.
What did you both do?
What does the girl want to know?
What does the girl want to know?
Who are you leaving in charge?
Why are you reading that book?
Tom is allowed to do that.
Why would Tom need to do that?
Does anyone really believe Tom?
That could take several months.
Some say he never existed.
What was she doing when you saw her?
This is the moment I've been waiting for all my life.
Some things that Tom told me aren't true.
You don't want everyone to know, do you, Tom?
I'm keeping the baby.
I didn't tell her. She found out by herself.
I don't know what I'll do when you're gone.
He's the man I told you about.
I don't know what this is about.
Can't you just be nice to each other?
She never listens to me.
Sit up straight in your chair.
You should know that by now.
I was crazy about that boy.
I was crazy about that girl.
Were you about to say something?
Were you about to say something?
I was about to say something.
I was about to say something.
Tom believes he's right.
She was a little girl then.
Some of my friends smoke.

If I had money, I could buy it.
If I had money, I could buy it.
If I had money, I could buy it.
Thanks for the delicious meal.
The writer is working on his new book.
Follow that car!
It's super easy!
I was away.
If I wanted to do that, I would have already done it.
I should have stayed in bed.
Tom isn't too bright.
Who will you go with?
I like that person.
You were the one behind this.
It's Tom. What's he doing out here?
See you in the morning.
He died a quick death.
That'll never happen.
Tom studies all the time.
You look like you don't want to be here.
He must have already come.
Not the one who is right is deemed right, but the one who has more rights.
They can be understood, too.
What time do you usually get off your work?
Jim raised his hand.
It won't be any problem at all.
He jumped to the conclusion that I had done it.
You could've told me earlier.
You could've told me that before.
You could've told me earlier.
What would you like to learn?
I should have kept my mouth shut.
He should have kept his mouth shut.
She should have kept her mouth shut.
Tell me your name, honey!
He always asks when you will return.
We are fed up with studying.
This tree is about as high as that one.
Do it!
Do it!
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.
There's not enough food for all of us.
God gave the man two ears and a mouth so that he would listen more and talk less.
To keep good silent is more difficult than to speak well.
My men are prepared to die.
Stay home until six.
Stay home until six.
Stay home until six.
I could kill you.

Where do you see the books?
You need new shoes.
I want him to solve the problem.
You're standing on my foot.
You're standing on my foot.
What on earth gave you that idea?
I would like to become multilingul.
A leopard never changes his spots.
I would like to become multilingul.
Are your parents home?
Nobody understands it.
Nobody understands it.
This desk is mine.
He came into my room.
I'll go first!
Tom eats the same food every day.
Why was he laughing?
How did you get into our room?
Do you really love me?
I even work on Sundays.
I didn't understand because they spoke in a low voice.
I'd help you if I could.
I'd help you if I could.
You will find this lesson easy.
To us!
I'm still here and I'm not going away.
I don't know why Tom did this.
Who loves war?
I think she is sick.
We buy bread.
I think that she knows the truth.
I have to open the window.
Tom hasn't eaten yet.
Work makes life sweet.
I can do it by myself!
When was your last day off?
Don't leave.
Put that down.
Put that down.
He was just behind me.
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
The floor must be very clean.
We have an answer.
Was Tom telling the truth?
Do you like the plan?
Tom was in the army.
Anyway, it's not your problem.
There were many wounded.
She asked about my school.
I think it's doable.
They had several children.
How do you like this town?
How do you like this town?
I left your book in the car.
Answer my question.
Answer my question.
That was my biggest problem.
That was my biggest problem.
It was a hard day.
It was a long day.
He has already told the police what happened.
He has already told the police what happened.
Maybe I'm working too much.
I just can't understand this.
It's exactly what I thought.
I've never had that problem.
Happiness has come and requires money.
We aren't right or left because we are valenki.
We get nothing so cheaply as we want.
I'll tell you everything I know.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Things will get easier from now on.
Tell me about your children.
It was a cold day.
Do you want to go with me?
Do you want to come with me?
I didn't know them then.
I didn't know him then.
I didn't know her then.
I do not want to reply to his letter.
I almost never remember dreams.
What else can it be?
Tom says he's fine.
No one has a weapon.
Was it all worth it?
Tom is going to explain it to all of us.
Look at that dog.
Look at that dog.
How many people did you kill?
OK, let's begin!
I want to buy a book.
Do you believe what Tom told us?

You're not good at this.

Please go ahead without me.
Please go ahead without me.
Tom is the one who was here last week.
This is our land now.
I'm looking for a place to sit.
He is doing his work.
Tom said we can stay.
How much can we take?
I used to come here.
I couldn't have done it without your help.
I couldn't have done it without your help.
How fast can you walk?
The dog is running across the street.
The dog is running across the street.
Tom stands up for us.
Tom tried to kill us.
Tom used to be weird.
They accepted that.
Tom may be the best person for the job.
What were you doing, Dad?
I told you so.
If only he had known!
Is Tom ready for that?
I couldn't help with anything.
Don't just sit there! Move!
We really don't have time.
It is an army of 70.000 men.
You should be seen by a doctor.
I have a lot to do at the moment.
She really doesn't like dogs.
I'm not asking them to forgive me.
We're related by marriage.
It speaks for itself.
Tom was thirsty.
He was thirsty.
Tom's thirsty.
I was thirsty.
I'm not thirsty.
How many people were there?
Don't be a baby!
Are there books in your house?
The book was new.
Must I stay home today?
They can come.
Tom had to stay home.

We may never know why that happened.
Would you like some more tea?
The man's name is Tom.
Will Tom stay with us?
No one wanted it.
No one seems to know.
No one seems to know.
No one knew about it.

I won't leave you alone.
I'm going to help Tom.
Why didn't you do it?
Why didn't you do it?
This is a good system.

I just kept going.
Could it have been Tom?
Tom saw her.
Tom saw him.

I heard it from you.
We're not afraid of a fight.
I gave her money, so she could buy me earphones.
It was a dream.
Are you my doctor?
How do you know I even want that job?
It's high time the children went to bed.
Tom knows what you did.
Tom knows what you did.
There must be a solution.
That's not a solution.
Tom never asked.
He saved my life at the risk of his own.
Tom isn't like other boys.
He answered my question with a "no."
That was a good decision.
Why did she ask for our help?
I know you've been trying to help.
I can't leave you here.
My dog didn't do that.
That's why I was there.
That's why I was there.
Look at the girls.

Tom did that three months ago.
Do you believe in reincarnation?
Do you believe in reincarnation?
Did you see what Tom did?

He decided to come.
The question is what for.
The question is what for.
Do you like these songs?
Please don't write to me again.
Can I be your friend?
I felt fear.
You have no right to ask me that.
I belong here.
Don't tell Tom what really happened.

I saw him cut down a tree.
It isn't worth it.
Did you call an ambulance?

OK, that's all for today.

Tell me what I can do.
Tell me what I can do.
You can do that.
You can do that.
I know you're trying to help.

Where's my coffee mug?
Tom never laughs.
I feel that something is going to happen really soon.
Tom came next.
Why does Tom have to go?
He came home at six.
You got back home.
Bosses are people, too.
We really have a lot to do.
It's a very slow process.
Isn't that what they want?
We'll get back to you.
I'll get back to you.
I can't help you with that.
Tom saw everything that happened.
Tom is my uncle.
That's your seat.
You must come home.
You must come home.
You must come home.
I have to leave.
I don't like when you bring your work home.
I really don't know why that happened.
How many times have you been there?
Are you for or against my plan?
I want you to tell me about what happened.
I want you to tell me about what happened.
Give me a job.
How often do you come here?
Why have I never heard of her?
Why have I never heard of her?
I'd like a bottle of water.
I have heart problems.
Let's not get crazy.
Has Tom really come back?
Has Tom really come back?
I think we should sit down.
I don't even want to think about that.
How do you feel now?
Tom called my name.
Who else could've done it?
I love trees.
Do you want me to open the box?
Who are your enemies?
Keep driving.
I like the same things you do.

Do you eat a lot?
We're able to do that.
Whatever you do, don't do that.
Whatever you do, don't do that.
That's why I have to do this.
Children shouldn't drink wine.
I think it's true.
I just do what I'm told.
I'd like to know what you think.
I think this is the best plan.
Can you show me how this works?
Tom used to do it.
Everyone's against me!
I'm thinking of the plan.
Do you two work together?
This room is too hot.
You should tell your mother as soon as possible.
Tom doesn't think it'll snow tomorrow.
Tom has already done it.
Tom has done it already.
Tom says I look like a kid.
What did the doctors say?
Where's Tom sitting?
Tom told us a long story.
Tom has done a very good job.
I really should go.
Tom was hungry.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tom answered yes.
It's a big company.
I told you what time to come.
I told you what time to come.
Maybe that'll be enough.
We know where you've been.
Why was there nobody here?
Won't you stay for supper?
This isn't what Tom wanted.
Look at that picture.
Do you believe that he is telling the truth?
Real women have curves.
Today is the oldest I've ever been, and the youngest I'll ever be again.
I felt like I would die.
She's still alive.
I miss her.
Tom isn't listening.
The coast is clear.
What in the world are you doing here?
Where is she going?
He plays baccarat.
That night was very cold.
They'll respond.
They had only one child.
Did you go to the police?
Do you want to see my baby?
Do you want to see my baby?
Someday you'll know the truth!
Were you looking for these glasses?
Are these the glasses you were looking for?
You used to like coming here.
Don't let Tom die.
Tom is good to me.
When did you arrive there?
When did you arrive there?
I'll return to Australia in two days.
Are you off your meds?
Don't leave this room.
My uncle keeps a dog.
This is enough for me.
This was more difficult than I thought it would be.
This was more difficult than I thought it would be.
This shouldn't happen.
Tom must be home by now.
You must act like a man.
I'd like to know what happened.
I'd like to know what happened.
I want to know what happened.
He is an author.
I'm going to be fine in a moment.
I'm dealing with the problem now.
I'm not looking forward to this.
I didn't want to believe it.
What a strange woman!
Tom realized it was time to go.
You can use this car.
Let me know as soon as you know.
How was I supposed to know?
I'm not myself.
She's not herself.
He's not himself.
I'm glad you're okay.
What kind of question is that?
I was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
She was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
He was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
Can you tell me what happened?
Can you tell me what happened?
You're not above the law.

Even if I knew, I couldn't tell you.
This box is heavy.
I must be dreaming.
I was afraid of making the first move.
She was afraid of making the first move.
He was afraid of making the first move.
Isn't he a bit young?
Isn't she a bit young?
How long did it take to do that?
My dad will kill me.
She wasn't there last month.
I wasn't here last week.
She ran her fingers through his hair.
Does he know how you feel?
She likes it when I do that.
It's a dead-end relationship.
Get out of my room!
It's right in front of your eyes.
It's right in front of your eyes.
It's right in front of your eyes.
You've got the wrong man!
She's on her way home.
He's on his way home.
She made me some eggnog.
Give us some time.
Tom needed the cash.
You're doing it wrong!
We had to leave quickly.
I did this myself.
I was a bit hungry.
Tom asked me why I did it.
Tom is playing on his gamecube.
Why did you decide to study English?
Why did you decide to study English?
What's your favorite newspaper?
Tom fled to Canada.
He doesn't know what he's doing!
He doesn't know the meaning of fear.
I didn't know that I had to do that.
I've been to Australia.
It was a short conversation.
It's always been quiet here.
It's a really good question.
It's a really good question.
I gave him a couple of books.
I gave her a couple of books.
Tom had a splenectomy.
Doctor, I have memory problems.
Tom feels unwanted.
Everyone is doing it.
Tom is in the lead.
I learned a lot this weekend.
Tom has an extravagant lifestyle.
Tell me your plans for the future.
She passed me pretending not to know me.
Why would somebody do something like that?
Why would somebody do something like that?
That person you spoke about is my sister.
We waited there all night.
We need to do this quickly.
Tom is working on it.
Who was in second place?
Tom beat Mary black and blue.
Tom always goes to the supermarket where Mary works.
Tom is photogenic, isn't he?
The police say Tom wasn't armed.
Who likes reading books?
Tom can't come because he's sick.
There's a reason for that.
You're a good girl.
Tom got up quickly.
It's finally my turn.
I'd like a tea.
She loves me more than him and she loves me more than he.
Tom is smiling now.
Tom could stop this.
Tom hasn't eaten for three days.
I have to tell Tom.
He was living in London when the war began.
I was in Paris with my husband.
Who knows this guy?
I'd like a double with a bath.
Pretend you know something.
There seems to be something wrong with this clock.
How much did they charge you for that?
That's my point exactly.
What's the plan, Tom?
You've got to give me more time.
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Please give me a sheet of paper.
What's Scotland like in summer?
You shouldn't even try making sense of it.
This bus will take you to the town.
This bus will take you to the village.
This time you should do it by yourself.
Tom didn't want to think about it.
Just give me three more minutes.
Nobody else would help Tom.
Is that car yours?
I had my reasons.
Did you understand what he meant?
Tom opened his eyes again.
This did not happen.
Where's your car, Tom?
This game came out yesterday.
I feel sorry for whoever doesn't like him.
Are they really soldiers?
The book is on the desk.
She couldn't open that bottle.
It'd be good if it wouldn't rain tomorrow.
What are you laughing at, Tom?
Turkey is nice, as long as you keep your mouth shut.
Tom talked about his family.
I've dreamed of this.
Tom fooled us all.
Why did Tom leave you?
Nobody thinks you're the one who did it.
You don't have to pay.
You don't have to pay.
You don't have to pay.
Let them eat if they want to.
It's a good plan, isn't it?
There are people who talk just because they have a mouth.
What games do you have on your phone?
Don't scream, or I'll scream louder.
You'll never know the truth.
This kind of weather makes me want to stay inside.
This kind of weather makes me want to stay inside.
Is that not possible anymore?
Isn't this against the rules?
Is that not possible anymore?
Tom is thin.
Here, look for yourself.
That couldn't happen.
Hey, here's a thought.
Hey, here's a thought.
Could you elaborate on that?
This place feels like home.
This place feels like home.
Dad, put Mum on the phone.
Tom speaks three languages.
I had no idea you were so young.
We don't go to school on Saturdays.
I'm going to buy a home.
Tom was there, but he didn't help us.
I think I can help with that.
They're afraid of me.
Are you watching the game?
How do you like your new car?
Warren Harding was an honest man.
Who was that woman I saw you with?
I'll answer you tomorrow.
I'll answer you tomorrow.
I thought you, of all people, would understand.
We know what you're doing.
We know what you're doing.
We go there often.
I don't like what Tom did.
He only had 100 dollars.
How long have you been staying in Osaka?
People don't want to hear that.
Tom understands what I mean, I think.
Tom understands what I mean, I think.
Have they done it?
It's not blood.
I like your avatar.
I love my house.
Tom never talks about his kids.
I don't believe that it happened.
What has she done today?
You really do have a beautiful voice.
Has Tom done this before?
They're absolutely right.
He doesn't believe his father is coming back.
He doesn't believe his father is coming back.
There were no more questions.
Maybe this girl is a ladyboy.
Maybe this girl is a ladyboy.
Do you still love your wife?
Well, what's wrong with that?
Well, what's wrong with that?
Do you have my book?
Do you have my book?
Did you just get up?
Did you just get up?
Get out of my sight!
It took almost a year for the pain to go away.
Tom has been there three times.
That's what we're waiting for.
Everybody knows what Tom did.
You'll never know the truth.
We understood each other.
Wasn't that what you wanted?
Isn't this what you wanted?
It's not my problem anymore.
It's not my problem anymore.
You're the only person I know here.
You're the only person I know here.
You're the only person I know here.
You're the only person I know here.
You've had enough time.
We'll never know the truth.
When were you in Australia?
We haven't reached our goal.
Tom isn't afraid of anybody.
Everybody likes me.

He has just arrived.
Tom said that he never said that.
Where's your book? "On the table."
She stayed at a cheap hotel.
He tried not to look at her.
Tom is caught between Scylla and Charybdis.
I'll remain in New York for five days.
The boy is right.

How can Tom not understand this?
How can Tom not see that?
It's an old name.
Moscow is in Russia.
I may not have enough time.
A great man has died.

Tom and Mary had two sons: Paul and John.
Do you like the new school better?
Do not tell me what to do.
Do not tell me what to do.
I pretended that I didn't understand.

I was not born yesterday.
Another problem has come up.
Do you have any problems with that?
Do you have any problems with that?
I do want it.
He's really in good shape.
How long did you stay at her place?
Tom never laughed.
Which Harry Potter book is your favorite?

My parents live in a big house.
Tom told everyone that I didn't want to go.
Tom told everyone that I didn't want to go.
I am in the same class as my brother.
I'm afraid of my boss.
This can be done.
What would we do?
Tom said he wanted to die.
We're still open.
Tom says he doesn't remember what happened that night.
We're both men.
Tom was like a son to me.
We've done a lot.
Tom says that he didn't do it.
What are your plans for tomorrow?
It was my destiny.
I believe in that.
I couldn't buy it.
I couldn't buy it.
Tom wants to be with us.
Tom has really helped us.
Tom wasn't a very good man.

He's afraid of his father.
The old man is near death.
Why do I have to be here?
My plan is working.
What language are you speaking?
The meeting went well.
Tom helped me clean up the mess.
Not all Germans like to drink beer.
I'll drink to that.
Do you want me to call an ambulance?
Tom sat in the first row.
You weren't supposed to come today.
Please tell me you're not leaving.
Tom is right behind us.
Sometimes people eat too fast.
How did they die?
He's very strong.
Tom left three hours ago.
We all need help from time to time.
I was going to tell the truth.
Can I come with you?
The old man knows that he will die soon.
Tom didn't understand it.
Tom doesn't believe that.
Tom didn't even smile.
Tom asked me if I liked it.

They are eating bread.
Tell the truth.

I want a bed next to the window.
I pretended not to understand what he was saying.
Was it worth it?
I don't know who this man is.
If you don't talk louder, he won't be able to hear you.
Who's Tom? Is he your new boyfriend?
I knew Tom was the one who did it.
You can't keep us here.
You can't keep us here.

I really didn't care.
I was ready to do it.

I think they're ready.
I'll never go there.

I'll never do that.
I've got long hair.
We don't get a lot of rain around here.
Show me what's in your pockets.

I didn't really care.
I do that all the time.
I feel I can do that.
I felt I had to stay.
I agreed with that.
I can't study here.
I didn't read that.
I could have done it.
I was very flattered.
I didn't understand what you said.
I didn't understand what you said.
I didn't understand what you said.
Let us know whether you can come.
Tom was here, too.
The paper is under the table.
Tom is holding a bottle of beer.
Maybe people like us shouldn't have children.
This country needs him.

I've heard that story before.

I know that he arrived yesterday.
I just got an idea.
What do you mean?
I think I see something.
You tell us the truth.
You tell us the truth.
Now I live with my uncle.
Someone might see us.
Everyone left except us.
What do you mean?
We're going to work together.
That's what's going to happen.
Everyone knows what's going on.
We haven't met yet.
Tom is strange sometimes.
Tom didn't come to work today.
You'll ask them, won't you?
You'll ask them, won't you?
You'll ask him, won't you?
You'll ask him, won't you?
You'll ask her, won't you?
You'll ask her, won't you?
Why didn't you tell us? "You didn't ask."
I work for myself.
I'm sorry. I forgot about it.
Let's start with beer.
Well, why not?
I'm waiting for you in my room.
I'm waiting for you in my room.
Where has she bought these books?
It'll take hours.
Let him do it.
Three weeks went by.
I have always liked the mountains.
How long should I wait here?
I didn't understand what it meant.
She died in your arms.
He died in their arms.
She died in their arms.
He died in your arms.
She died in your arms.
This is our decision.
He did as he was told.
You killed my mother.
Dalida died from an overdose of sleeping pills.
It happens to all of us.
It happens to all of us.
The world is big.

We're on the brink of war.
My mother didn't want me to be like that.
My mother didn't want me to be like that.
He knows neither me, nor you.
He knows neither me, nor you.
I could've done that without your help.
What do you all do?
That's all there was.
The dog looked into the water.
Was it all a dream?
Was it all a dream?
This happens all the time.
I'm all for that.
I was home all night.
I'm absolutely fine.
Yes it's mine.
This book isn't too bad.
I want the same.
Just stay there.
Watch me now.
Just take it.
Show me.
I want to be the boss.
I knew all about that.
Are you hungry at all?
You'd better not go to school tomorrow.
Tom said that he would give you a book.
Tom said that he would give you a book.
The dog is mine.
My girlfriend lives in New York.
We knew enough.
I looked him straight in the eye.
Have you told your parents about her?
Fine, Tom. Have it your way.
It must be true.
Tom is in his room now.
Tom is in his room now.
I'm not going to go.
I'm not sure what happened.
I know how to count to 100.
You're not getting any younger.
Let's not wait any longer.
Why do you do it, Tom?
Do you have something to show me?
I wanted it.
We went to a restaurant.
And what if we went to a Japanese restaurant tonight?
It's my fault, not yours.
I hadn't even noticed.
I live by my own rules.
I know it now for sure.
I don't want to stay home.
I don't want to stay home.
I know Tom isn't the one who did this.
I'll never forget your face.
The box she found was empty.
The box he found was empty.
They are not enemies, but friends.
Later, I found out his real name was Tom.
Please write a letter to me.
Didn't you know that?
Who is that young woman?
I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to.
Everyone pretended not to listen.
If I were you, I wouldn't go there by myself.
Maybe you didn't understand me.
Maybe you didn't understand me.
I've been waiting a long time for you.
I've been waiting a long time for you.
I've been waiting a long time for you.
When will Tom get back home?
Now I know what love is.
I'm not dead yet.
I'm not dead yet.
We may not have time.
Nobody understands what's going on in the head of President Erdogan.
That shouldn't have happened.
I decided not to eat.
They're not so bad.
They're not so bad.
We aren't dead yet.
Let's give Tom a minute.
I thought you were going to kill me.
You have to stay in bed until next Monday.
Where are you planning on going this evening?

First, we have to find out where they live.
Is he really coming?

Do you already know what to do?

There are women to whom we make love, and those, to whom we speak about it.
They're not my rules.
They're not always right.
I'm not the boss.
Not even one taxi stopped.
Is that so hard to do?
Do you really want me to go?
Do you really want me to go?
Do you really want me to go?
I'm not thin.

A child needs a mother.
Thanks for noticing.

I didn't even know his name.
I didn't even know his name.
I want to be in this group.
Was it worth it?
I'll go tell Tom.
Now we can be together.
There was blood on the floor.
You're doing a good job.
I wouldn't do that.
I didn't take your money.
I didn't take your money.
I didn't understand that.
The children were playing in the dirt.
I don't know who Tom gave that to.
I already gave it to Tom.
I already gave it to Tom.
I already gave it to Tom.
Sorry, I don't think I can do it.
Did Tom do this?
I had no idea Tom would do that.
I was lying on my back.
I was the last one to know.
I was the last one to know.
I was there a year ago.
I don't need a job.
I knew where to go.
I'm still the boss.
I try to do what I can.
Let me explain the rules.
They should've noticed me.
He has few friends here except you.
I'm strong enough.
Is this my fault or your fault?
Is this my fault or your fault?
Tom asked me to do it for him.
Tom said he would never come back here again.
Who's not coming?
That's not the reason.
Night is for sleeping.
Yes, I think you should go there.
If you want to, we'll go.
If that happened, what would you do?
If that happened, what would you do?
We're behind you.
We're behind you.
I'll stay if it rains.
My brother isn't home.
I would love to see it.
I'll explain the rules.
Which one of these boys will you give the book to?
Which one of these boys will you give the book to?
Who's your doctor?
Every day I go to the café and have coffee.
Tom knew I was coming.
We're very happy for you.
Don't tell me you're not scared.
I think I've found a solution to your problem.
Can I stay here?
I think it's my turn.
This is my other sister.
Where can I catch a bus?
Tell him to leave.
Tell him to leave.
Tell him to leave.

Tell her to leave.

This was easier than I thought it would be.
If anything bad had happened, I would've been told.
Why don't you tell me what happened?
Why don't you tell me what happened?
We're all alone here.
We're all alone here.
We're alone here.
I saw it from the window.
Give Tom a chair.
Give Tom a chair.
I know I can do more.
I can't go to the cops.
I couldn't write a single word.
I couldn't write a single word.
I've always liked that name.
We left immediately.
We left immediately.
Tom never used to do that.
I used to think like you.
People used to laugh at us.
I used to have very long hair.
I used to think that was true.
You used to like me, didn't you?
I used to think the same way you do.
I used to think the same way you do.
This is a hard job.
I don't know what it was.
I don't mean that at all.
I don't quite understand.
I don't mean you.
I don't mean you.
I don't feel like a hero.
You shouldn't eat so much ice cream.
I started doing this job four years ago.
Tom doesn't come here as often as he used to.
Did you get on the wrong bus again?
I didn't have time to do anything else.
I didn't have time to do anything else.
What are you going to do here?
What are you going to do here?
Tom slowly rose from his chair.
Tom slowly rose from his chair.
Tom should be here in a couple of hours.
Tom was sitting in the front of the bus.
Tom must come.
The only thing left to do is wait!
You can have both.
You can have both.
Now, it's my turn to laugh.
No book is worth reading.
She knows what to do now.
You can come at any time.
I would like to know who my parents are.
I really have to go to bed.
She dumped him.
My girlfriend dumped me.
My girlfriend dumped me.
He was dumped by his girlfriend.
I see why Tom dumped you.
She succeeded in opening the box.
She always believes in me.
Tom can't read music.
She must be his girlfriend.
Read good books.
Read good books.
Give her what she wants.
Give her what she wants.

How do you make a box?
Can you tell me who is coming tonight?

I want a better future for my children.
I was the last one to know about that.

I haven't had a day off in a long time.
I don't think we have to do this now.
I don't think we have to do this.
I don't like what you're doing.

I am trying to find a new job.
Why are you scared of me?
Your uncle and I have known each other for many years.
We have to get better.
Tom is a bad person. "In what way?"
This is very good soil.
I want to stay here a couple more days.
My town has a population of about 30,000 people.
Tom hasn't written the letter yet.
You might see them there.
My watch stopped, so I didn't know the time.
At least I can see you.
People don't wish for what they own.
Tom wasn't afraid to die.
Did you take a shower today?
If you don't like it, don't eat it.
Will you give it to me?

Tom loves his children, of course.
What exactly don't you get?
Tom is still sick.

How did you find out about this place?

He gave her a box.
That's not what we want.
Is that the only way out?
Well, what did you find out?

Don't you know each other?
Never play here.

All the other windows are open.

It's almost 2:30 in the morning.
Where have you been for the past three months?
How many hours are left?
I'm going to do that again.
I'm not that type of guy.
You have to live here.
Tom looked at the painting.
I haven't managed to get help from anyone.
Try to work together.
Try to work together.
Tom just didn't understand.
Tom is a little older than the rest of the students in his class.
Why can't we work together?
If you're going to kill me, I want to know why.
If you're going to kill me, I want to know why.

I was the only one who knew where Tom had gone.
I was the only one who knew where Tom had gone.
What's Tom got against me?
I like to listen to you when you speak.
Listening to a language being spoken is very different from reading or writing the same language.
Do you like the poem I wrote for you?
I've been waiting for this moment all my life.
Did you find out where Tom lives?
How did you find out where I live?
How did you find out where I live?
What kind of men do you like?
What kind of men do you like?
Tom can't have written this letter.
Tom showed me the letter.
He came back before eight.
When will you come home?
There's very little time left.
Did Tom say why he was leaving?
Does this mean I have to leave?
Are you asking me to leave?

If I were you, I'd buy that one.

Do you believe in spirits?
Who knows more about you than your own mother?

Tom, tell me the truth.
I don't know how it can be done.

Both Piotr and Lech are from Poland.

I did my part.
I did everything right.
I did it quickly.

Dinner was expensive.
Can you give me your phone number?

I put the book on the table in the living room.
I'll visit whenever I can.
Your time will come soon.
You can come, but don't tell anybody else.
Can I help you with that?
Tom was afraid to ask for help.
I thought Tom would agree with me.
I'll get in trouble if I do that.
If you're not going to eat those, can I?
Tom returned to England after the war.
It might rain.
Okay, I'm coming!
Where's your watch?
If possible, this weekend.
Everybody knows that Tom did it.
It was she who has told me.
That's a beautiful story.
It started raining as soon as we got home.
We express thought with language.
It rained two days ago.
Her socks are gray.
Do you really think Tom is handsome?
You must come here tomorrow.
You're the only one who can help us now.
Tom is the only person who can do this work.

Who was sitting here?
So, what do you say?
What're you going to do with that?
They'll know what to do.
I was at home almost all day yesterday.
Would you like a dog?
You look like your dad.
You look like your dad.
I'm not able to do that.
Tom could've taken the money.
That's very hard to do.
Tom has always been kind to me.
I have to do something while I still can.
Don't tell me you can't read.
Which is cheaper, this or that?
Tom was scared stiff.
Does Tom know what you're doing?
Tom didn't like his name.
Forget what I said yesterday.

They recognized each other.
I'll stay in the car.
Do you still need our help?
Do you want to stay here?
He's a former president of the country.
We had similar problems.
I've never been hungrier in my life!
I told them to stop.
Am I too old for this?
Are they worth it?
They didn't even know how to write their own names.
We just couldn't do it.
A man can't always be a hero, but he can always be a man.
I explained it to her.
What did you reply?
I've asked you several times not to do that.

Since you're so smart, why don't you do it yourself?

The children sat cross-legged around the fire.
Do you mind if I sit next to you?
Tom doesn't like talking about his feelings.
We never learned what happened or why.
Strange things happened in that house.
All you can do is wait.
The results weren't very good.
All you can do is wait.
Your family needs you.

He left a window open.
Wasn't that what you wanted?
You know, Tom, that's exactly what I was thinking.
Let's go home.
Don't think about it.

Where did he go yesterday?
Where does your sister live now?
I think you know where I want to go.
I think you know where I want to go.

Her boss is hard to deal with.
Would they do that?
For this test, I bought a voltage tester.
You are my best friend!
Tom is very photogenic, isn't he?
What's everybody laughing about?
I am a girl.
Today is Wednesday, yes?
Buses always come in threes.
I don't think Tom did this.
Now this is your problem, not mine.
Now this is your problem, not mine.
What exactly am I looking for?
I haven't eaten for a couple of days.

Let's face the truth.
Tom wasn't wearing a uniform.
I never liked her anyway.
I never liked him anyway.
I was in Iran.
I have not seen him for a long time.
It happened so long ago.
Tom can't already imagine his life without a car.
This car is not mine.
I don't like hearing myself.
I saw a strange light in the woods.
There are strange things happening in the woods.
Strange things have happened in these woods.

I forgot where my school is.

I'm not ready to go yet.
You'll be the first to know.
You'll be the first to know.
You'll be the first to know.
Tom wanted to know the truth.
Tom wanted to tell the truth.
Tom raised his right hand.
Nobody tells the truth anymore.
Your parents know where you are.
It was very quick.
Grab him.
Tom arrived.
Tom looked.
Look what happened.
Tom knows everybody.
You knew this would happen!
Was this Tom's plan all along?
I've been able to read since I was six years old.
You're right! I'd never thought of it.
Stay as long as you'd like.
It's time for me to leave.
You can't leave.
You can't leave.
You can't leave.
Maybe you were right.

It took an hour.
Tom, someone is here to see you.
You understand this, don't you?
You understand this, don't you?
They went to Sao Paulo.
I tried to find out her telephone number.
I've got a toothache. The pain is killing me.
Look for an enemy of your enemy, and you will find a friend.
My car is faster than yours.
My car is faster than yours.
Every problem can be solved.
I don't like being laughed at.
No, you are not crazy.
Tom will stay with us.
Suddenly, it started to rain very hard.
Tom is the tallest boy in our class.
Tom had to do that even though he didn't want to.

It'll take less than an hour to do that.
Tom believes in reincarnation.
They're having the same problems we are.
Tom was one of the best.
How's your wife, Tom?
His father wanted him to be a doctor.
Our mothers are strong women.
We are different people.
I'd like to say a word or two about that.
What do you need a doctor for?

Tom's a very bad guy.
Why did you agree?

Where do you want to go tomorrow?

It's hard to tell what Tom is going to do.
Her hair was as red as fire.
Open the window!
We were soldiers.
It's gotten easier.
It's happening now.
It's easy for them.
Tom could've done something.
Thanks for coming. It means a lot to me.

Tell Tom that I need his help.
They were murdered.
I have an appointment at 2:30.

I build houses out of stone.
I made you coffee.
You're acting like a child.
What happened to the dog?

I really like your eyes.
It was too easy.
What do you intend to do with that?
I didn't study.
Tom didn't even try to get up.
That was me.
I'm looking for answers.
Tom thought he was going to die.
The only language Tom knows how to speak is French.
I didn't know Tom could play the trombone so well.
Why didn't you just take the money?
If I can do it, so can you.
I want to know who your friends are.
Keep searching.
Do you remember what to do?
I want to find out what Tom did yesterday.
Nahuatl was the language of the Aztecs.

Tom was better.
Tom is afraid of you.

Tom isn't going to wait.
Everyone knows what happened next.
I don't know if that will help.
Tom gave me this book.
You have such a beautiful name.
How many men named Tom do you know?

Each boy has his own room.
Don't try to be me. Be yourself!
Politicians don't always tell the truth.
I discovered a new game this summer.
All the money in the world isn't enough to buy me.
Tom doesn't seem to like me.
I'll stay for a week.
Did Tom really say that?

Who could've done that?
You're a strange girl.

I'm going back home tomorrow.
Tom needs help now.
Do you know about that?
Why didn't you tell me you were sick?

You can come home.
You can come home.
We'd better go, Tom.
Let's do this as quickly as possible.
Let's do this as quickly as possible.
We went to Russia.
What's Tom done now?
Do you have to do this very often?
Do you have to do this very often?
What is it now, Tom?
I am a 22 year-old man.
All Tom did was eat.
I tried to tell Tom.
May I put it here?
May I put it here?
I'll see how Tom is.
I don't have a solution.
She smiled at him.
She went with him.
Nobody went there.
Nobody went there.
Tom didn't remember.
I'd kill you if I could.
I'd kill you if I could.
Tom is good at that.
He asked for help.
Is that your book?
Tom is at a meeting.
Listen up.
Tom is in bad shape.
It's raining here.
Give her the book.
Give her the book.
When do you write?
I told you I didn't want to do this.
He is on a roll.
Tom is a big boy now.
Tom's a big boy now.
How's your mother?
Look into my eyes.
I heard Tom come in.
How are you feeling today?
How are you feeling today?
It was a new book.
Do you want to go?
Do you want to go?
Do you want to go?
Do you want to go?
Do you want to go?
I was out all day.
When did you find out about it? "Find out about what?"
When did you find out the truth?
When did you find out the truth?
What did you say her name was?
Do it by yourself.
What did you say her name was?
What did you say her name was?
What did you say his name was?
What did you say his name was?
I think you know what I'm talking about.
I think you know what I'm talking about.
I can't wait for that to happen.
We all live on the earth.
Jack isn't there.
Tom took another gulp of wine.
Let them all come.
I watched Tom leave.
Was Tom still there?
Tom took out a loan from the bank, so he could buy a house.
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
What's Tom doing here at this hour?
She decided to go.
She isn't running.
She must go there.
She didn't go far.
Tom's the best.
Tom isn't very good company.
I was always the fastest.
I didn't know what Tom had done.
Tom is studying at his desk.
I need you here tomorrow.
I need you here tomorrow.
I didn't know Tom could do that.
I could see Tom was still alive.
I don't think you're fat.
I don't think you're fat.
I don't really want that.
I don't really want that.
I do believe in miracles.
I asked her if she was okay.
I've worked all my life.
Fortunately, Tom is still alive.
Does Tom really want to do that?
How do you know that'll happen?
How do you know that'll happen?
How do you know that'll happen?
How do you know that'll happen?
I think now is the time.
I felt like a rock star.
I'm not afraid of work.
I'm angry at everybody.
I'll stay home instead.
I'll stay home instead.
I went a different way.
Tom comes here once a month.
Tom can stay if he wants to.
Tom came back an hour later.
I know Tom may have to do that.
I was never told that.
I was never told that.
I know Tom has never done that.
Tom believes whatever I say.
Tom asked me if I loved him.
Tom arrived here last night.
How often does Tom come here?
They are sitting at the table.
Do you have any group in WhatsApp?
I'll do what I can for you.
I'll do what I can for you.
I'd like to know the truth.
Even Tom won't be able to help us.
Do you think Tom is still at home?
Do you think Tom is still at home?
I was gone for three hours.
I like playing with my dog.
I knew exactly what it was.
I felt something was wrong.
It must've been Tom who did that.
It must've been Tom who did that.
I wasn't aware that Tom was sick.
I'm really ready for this.
I heard that Tom is back in town.
I heard that Tom is back in town.
I wasn't sure what it was.
I thought they were wrong.
No one has told Tom what he has to do.
I always wanted to go there.
I always wanted to go there.
I'm not in the best of shape.
I fumbled in my pockets.
I'd give you more if I could.
I'd give you more if I could.
That's what Tom does most of the time.
I should've asked you before.
I should've asked you before.
I should've asked you before.
I should've asked you before.
This is the house Tom plans to buy.
I don't like what's going on.
A hundred dollars is nothing.
I have to do something to help Tom.
Ninja Turtles is my favorite game.
I live a totally normal life.
Where were they going? Do we know where we are going?
He may come today.
Tom didn't leave his apartment.
I'm just not going to do that.
I knew Tom wasn't the one who did that.
Of course, Tom loves his own children.
Just keep talking.
Just keep talking.
Just keep talking.
I know now what we have to do.
Just keep talking.
Tom explained why he was there.
He went back home.
He is at his desk.
Tom is following us.
Tom is following us.
He must work hard.
Tom explained why he was there.
He never came back.
Tom is coming today.
Tom has until Monday to decide.
I don't know what was going on.
I just wanted to see if I could do it.
There's another reason.
There's another reason.
Who would do this? And why?
I think Tom has been here.
I shouldn't have come here. I'm sorry.
I could do this myself.
Please don't tell anyone I was here.
Please don't tell anyone I was here.
Don't tell anyone I was here.
Don't tell anyone I was here.
I'm the one who makes the decisions.
Everyone's laughing at us.
I did everything I could today.
I've been waiting long enough.
I've been through this before.
Do you really think Tom is better than me?
Do you really think Tom is better than I am?
I feel like I'm ready for that.
I feel it's something I can do.
How did he behave?
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom is already dead.
Even Tom doesn't know about it yet.
Tom wanted to understand.
Everybody is afraid of criticism.
The question is whether he's still alive.
Tom is on duty.
I don't even know if Tom is still alive.
Tom did it for his family.
Tom isn't stronger than me.
I could help you.
I could help you.
I could help you.
I could help you.
Life is a great mystery.
Tom doesn't seem very hungry.
Tom realized something wasn't right.
Tom realized something wasn't right.
Do you still believe? "In God? Of course!"
I don't need your job.
I should call an ambulance.
We should think about it.
We should think about it.
May we go home?
That was a weird feeling.
I really like this guy.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
I would've done that for you.
Did you see anybody else in the park that night?
Thank you for helping us solve the problem.
She told her everything.
I'm waiting in line.
Have you decided yet?
Even Tom doesn't know it yet.
I don't like it when people yell at me.
Maybe I'll tell you and maybe I won't.
I was completely devastated.
What you go looking for, you will find.
Show me how much money you have.
Show me how much money you have.
I had to find another solution.
I had to find another solution.
I've never seen Tom behave this way before.
I just knew I couldn't do that.
It gets quite hot in the summer.
It gets quite cold in the winter.
If you don't know where you're going, you might not get there.
Not everyone agreed.
Tom has always wanted to be No. 1.
While we were doing that, another two hours passed.
We spent one night together.
This is how our relationship started.
I am the only child of my parents.
I am the only child of my parents.
I have two children: a boy and a girl.
I made that decision on my own.
Eventually, Tom found out what had happened.
Do you really think Tom is better than I am?
Do you really think Tom is better than I am?
Do you really think Tom is better than I am?
Do you really think Tom is better than me?
I just don't really understand.
I'll go by plane.
I'll go by plane.
Tom will go as well.
Show me what you've done so far.
Show me what you've done so far.
I can't be something I'm not.
He is near forty.
I just didn't want to be there.
I just didn't want to be there.
I just didn't want to be there.
I just didn't want to be there.
What've we just done?
I just wanted you to know that.
I just wanted you to know that.
I know it's a hard thing to do.
I knew you weren't really dead.
I knew you weren't really dead.
I think you should help Tom.
I couldn't help but agree.
I want answers to all of my questions.
Do you two already know each other?
I live in Dublin right now.
I live in Minnesota right now.
You should've come yesterday.
You should've come yesterday.
I want to go to college.
I wanted him to go there.
I wanted him to go there.
I want to go to Tokyo.
I want to go to Minnesota.
I want to go to Britain.
I want to go to Hawaii.
I would like to go, too.
Tom already knew what was wrong.
I never think about it anymore.
It gets quite hot here in the summer.
I read the newspaper every day.
I can't read.
I don't understand a word of what Tom is saying.
Tom bought a bottle of red wine.
Tom bought a bottle of red wine.
I share a room with my brother.
I think it really is a problem.
Tom didn't come home that night.
I think that's the best answer.
I think that's the best answer.
Tom didn't come out of his room.
Tom didn't know what to believe.
Tom didn't recognize the number.
Tom didn't recognize the number.
I thought you already did that.

I thought you'd ask about that.

I would like to go home now.
I would like to see Kylie Minogue.
Good morning, I would like to reserve a room.
I would like to live in a large city.
I would like to know how much it costs.
I would like to know how much it costs.
Tom explained the problem to me.
You can't just not go to work.
You can't just not go to work.
You can't just not go to work.
Tom can't have written this letter himself.
Tom can't have written this letter himself.
I'll take these with me.
We do like you.
Do you like your boss?
Do you like this girl?
Do you like my hair?
Do you like the mountain?
Do you like the apartment?
What bands do you like?
Do you really like your car?
This girl's eyes are blue.
This girl's eyes are blue.
May I go with him?
I don't feel like sleeping anymore.
Tell me about him.
I wish you were here.
I wish it were possible.
I wish I were different.
I wish I were different.
I wish I were in Paris.
I wish I could.
I wish I could go.
I wish you could stay.
I wish I could see her.
I wish I could see her.
I wish I could see you.
I wish I could remember it.
I don't know how to behave here.
But I don't know how to cook kebabs!
Permit me to stay.
Tom didn't bring it.
Tom didn't bring it.
When did Tom arrive?
When did Tom arrive?
Do you believe me?
Tom arrived at 2:30.
What on earth is an interrobang‽
I'm glad you're all right again.
What should we do now? How can we solve this?
Has Tom arrived yet?
I consented to go.
I consented to go.
Didn't Tom tell you?
I'm studying now.
Get me my glasses.
Get me my glasses.
Get me my glasses.
Come into my room.
Come into my room.
He lives in that yellow house.
We've been waiting long enough.
Tom took a few steps forward.
I like this restaurant.
It really works.
I wasn't going to go there.
I wasn't going to go there.
I wasn't going to go there.
When do I get to go home?
When may I go home?
The man who is standing there is my father.
Come on, stop thinking about that.
Tom doesn't do that anymore.
Can I stay?
I was told never to do that.
I wasn't in your apartment.
I wasn't in your apartment.
How long have you been waiting for the bus?
That's a question that only Tom can answer.
I think we'd better do that.
I'm being paid to do this.
Tom wouldn't listen.
I don't have a book.
Why did you want us to come here?
How many are there in your class?
I gave you a book.
Tom took everything.
Keep this in mind.
Tom started reading.
This book will do.
Tom should've asked.
Tom shouldn't drink.
Tom shouldn't drink.
How old is your brother?
I was hungry.
Isn't that theirs?
That rings a bell.
That rings a bell.
Please come again.
Go ahead and talk.
Go ahead and talk.
I just stubbed my toe.
Maybe one day you'll understand me.
Maybe one day you'll understand me.
How much time is left?
Haven't you ever done this before?
Haven't you ever done this before?
Haven't you ever done this before?
I'm looking for a guy. "I'm a guy, aren't I?"
I'm the boss now.
Do you want to know why I did that?
I'm the boss now.
I knew it would happen this way.
Tom asked me to come over.
Do you want to know the truth?
Do you want to know the truth?
I'm hungry because I haven't eaten.
I am the tallest of all the boys.
His whole family is like that.
I'm still the same person I used to be.
It's white.
Some children dislike school.
There aren't any rules.
I can't wait to leave.
Can you tell what I need to do?
I'm afraid of the policemen.
Tom took a sip of coffee.
I wish it were tomorrow already.
I wish it were tomorrow already.
I wish it were tomorrow already.
Tom approached them.
Tell Tom everything.
Stay in your car.
Stay in your car.
Mind your step.
This is a letter.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
I told Tom all about what we did yesterday.
I told Tom all about what we did yesterday.
We believe in a better world.
I don't believe such things exist.
I don't believe such things exist.
Tom knows he shouldn't have said that.
Tom knows he shouldn't have said that.
I left everything there.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Tom pretended not to be listening.
I can't explain why it happened.
I can't explain why it happened.
I didn't know you were a doctor.
I didn't know you were a doctor.
You won't get away.
I come from a family of doctors.
I'm glad I was able to do this.
I'll have to go there tomorrow.
I'll have to go there tomorrow.
I'll do what the boss tells me to do.
I'll be waiting for the answer.
Tom is one of my oldest friends.
I don't want to talk to you about this.
I don't want to talk to you about this.
Tom is a really good person.
Tom was going to help us.
Without me, you won't be able to do it.
Without me, you won't be able to do it.
I don't know what the problem is.
I don't know what the matter is.
I've been gone for a long time.
May I ask what book you are reading?
What would we do?
Well, it's time for me to run off. Bye!
Everyone around here likes me.
Tom didn't go alone.
Tom didn't go alone.
This one is ours.
This one is ours.
Everybody likes Tom.
I got here first.
Will that happen?
I don't know if she has a brother.
I'm doing it now.
Why did Tom want it?
Why did Tom want it?
Can we come, too?
You must work.
She's on her way to Thailand.
I don't even understand myself.
Send us a letter.
Send us a letter.
We have to study.
Let's start at 2:30.
You have to be prepared.
The rest is easy.
Your hands are filthy.
Today's a bit hotter than usual, don't you think?
Now I can see where my real friends are.
She is a difficult person to deal with.
I'm Tom by the way.
By the way, where were you?
By the way, where were you?
By the way, where were you?
By the way, where do you live?
By the way, how old are you?
By the way, what do you do?
By the way, I saw him yesterday.
By the way, Tom is in town.
By the way, have you seen him lately?

By the way, are you called Robin as well?
Oh, by the way, do you know where she lives now?

I understand what you're trying to tell me.
I understand what you're trying to tell me.
I understand now what you were trying to tell me.

I finally understand what you have been trying to tell me all along.

I think I finally understand now.
I finally understand what you were trying to do.

We heard voices in the room.
Not even our fingers look alike.
You had time to think. What'd you decide?
The squirrel ate out of his hand.
The squirrel ate out of her hand.
The squirrel ate out of his hand.
The squirrel ate out of her hand.
I love trees, said the squirrel.
Tom is sitting at the table near the window.
Tom, look! The squirrel is back!
Tom, look! The squirrel is back!
I'm certainly not the only one.
I'm certainly not the only one.
I just don't love my wife.
How did you find out where Tom lives?
How did you find out where Tom lives?
Tom told me that he doesn't have any brothers or sisters.
I'm going to put it in my room.
I'm going to put it in my room.
My children like school.
Where on earth are we?
I live in the town centre.
My family live in that house.
I've never felt this good before.
It seemed normal.
You can call me Tom.
Look at our kids.
I like this club.
I just sat there.
Your baby can walk.
I was there, too.
I was on the bus.
I was baffled.
Tom, how's it going?
I work full time.
Go get some help.
Tom is barely alive.
Why did you decide to name your son Tarzan?
Why did you decide to name your son Tarzan?
I don't want anything to happen.
That's what Tom did most of the time.
I don't know why it's happening.
I don't know what that thing is.
What are you doing home?
What are you doing home?
What are you doing home?
What are you doing home?
I don't feel like a man anymore.
I didn't want to think about it.
Tom asked me to call him John from now on.
This almost never happens.
You were always a little odd.
Tom doesn't do that as often as he should.
Tom doesn't do that as often as he should.
How did he know my name?
Oh, no! I almost forgot!
Tom didn't come home from school yesterday.
Is this really worth it?
I've been here for a long time.
Tom is from the same village that I'm from.
Tom doesn't want people to know about that.
Tom doesn't want people to know about that.
I'm very happy to be back home.
Nobody knows where Tom went.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.

Maybe you shouldn't tell him.

Maybe you shouldn't tell me.
Maybe you shouldn't tell me.

Maybe you shouldn't tell them.
Maybe you shouldn't tell them.
Maybe you shouldn't tell us.
Maybe you shouldn't tell us.
I don't think Tom will understand that.
I'm not ready to have kids yet.
I'm not even thinking about it.
Tom has suggested a solution to the problem.
I'm going to be ready for that.
We arrived two days ago.
I don't know how Tom managed to do that.
I don't know what Tom thinks about that.
I'll do what the boss tells me.
I'd rather not do that anymore.
I'd love to have more children.
The kid already speaks pretty well.
I'd like to live in that house.
I'd like to live in that house.
I'd like to know what you mean.
I'd like to know what you mean.
I wasn't the only one to do so.
I wasn't the only one to do so.
I wasn't the only one to do so.
I was working when it happened.
I was outside when it happened.
He didn't come to the last meeting.
I was one of the last to leave.
I was one of the last to leave.
I waited a whole year for that.
I really thought I could do it.

I'll tell Tom the truth when the time comes.

I'll tell you what's happened.
I'll tell you what's happened.
I know what you could've done.
I know what you could've done.
Tom has been coming here three or four times a week.
I really didn't know what to do.
Tom has already spoken to me about it.
I never thought it would happen.
I don't know what Tom wants to do.
I knew what was going to happen.
I don't know why Tom didn't do it.
I just don't know what happened.
I just don't know what happened.
Give them a second.
Give them a second.
I really thought Tom was a doctor.
I had a very good day yesterday.
I feel sorry for these children.
I knew exactly what I had to do.
Tom looked at me and smiled.
They all began to laugh.
Tom slept nearly the whole way.
Tom came home all covered in mud.
Everything was silent.
I don't care who started it.
Is it always hot like this?
Let him sleep.
Tom didn't sleep all night.
Let's stand up.
Tom can't get up.
Tom can't stand up.
I think I will buy the red car.
I know why Tom is asking that question.
I remember telling you about it.
I remember telling you about it.
Tom is tall, but not as tall as me.
We want you back.
We want you back.
I took the blame.
I take the blame.
Give me that one.
Give me that one.
Give me that one.
Give me that one.
Give me that one.
Give me that one.
I begin tomorrow.
You're my guests.
You're my guest.
You're my guest.
You're my guests.
Wasn't it enough?
Tom was sitting at his desk.
Have you given Tom what he asked for?
Have you given Tom what he asked for?
Look at that man.
Look at that man.
Tom waited his turn.
Are you open now?
Who put it there?
Who put it there?
Open your window.
Open your window.
Open your window.
Open your window.
Will you take it?
Will you take it?

The fire was out.
Will you come with me? I don't want to go there alone.
Will you come with me? I don't want to go there alone.
It's clear they thought I was somebody else.
Let me come, too.
Tom didn't go there.
Tom didn't go there.
Tom didn't go there.
It was too small.
It was too small.
It was too small.
Why tell me this?
Why tell me this?
They were silent.
You're the guest.
You're the guest.
You're the guest.
You're the guest.
You're the worst.
You're the worst.
I get your drift.
I get your drift.
Tom opened his eyes.
Everyone felt it.
Everyone felt it.
It's what I'd do.
You were my life.
You were my life.
You were my life.
It's as I feared.
That's mine, too.
That's mine, too.
No one cared.
No one cares.
No one would've cared.
No one cared about you.
No one cared about you.
No one cares about that anymore.
I used to think no one cared.
I can't tell you about it yet.
Can't we leave it as it is?
Did you listen at all to what I said?
You can go there.
You can go there.
You can go there.
Get me some, too.
Get me some, too.
Tom could help you.
Tom could help you.
A lot of people feel the same way Tom does.
You can't give Tom that.
You can't give Tom that.
Maybe I should go with you.
Maybe I should go with you.
That's never happened to us before.
That's never happened to us before.
I could never do that.
I came as soon as I could.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Can I see you tomorrow?
Where are we going now?
Where are we going now?
Tom is very young, isn't he?
How much do those things cost?
What happened after that?
I'll tell everyone what you did.
I'll tell everyone what you did.
I think I can answer that.
Tom acted as if nothing had happened.
I would do it if Tom asked me to.
Tom came back last October.
Tom hasn't been here since last October.
I think you're right about that.
I think you're right about that.
It's the law now.
Your mom is here.
That's all Tom did.
I can't go there.
I can't go there.
I can't go there.
I can't go there.
Help me to do it.

Tom didn't need it.

The light was on.

Tom must be asleep.
What can I bring?
Is Tom really sick?
Leave the bottle.
Leave the bottle.
Can I go outside?
Tom was a nice kid.
Tom was a good kid.
Who decided that?
You need me here.
You need me here.
I can do it, too.
Leave them there.
Leave them there.
Did you bring it?
Did you bring it?
Did you bring it?
Did you bring it?
Please take this.

That's it.
I don't think that's the solution.

Let Tom stay there.
I'm not sure why.
Maybe Tom is right.
I can't show you.
I should go home.
It couldn't be Tom.
We can't go back.
Get away from me.
I know my rights.
They have been here for an hour.
Come with me now.
That's old news.
Tom was surrounded.

Who did you kill?
What a long week!
Tom kept screaming.
Explain it to me.

Please don't ask.
Tom said that he had everything under control.
You have made him what he is.
They didn't even know what to do.
She would have liked to have been born twenty years earlier.
I live in a city, but my parents lived in a village.
Give it to me!
The can is empty.
The town we live in is beside the sea.
Tom often comes here.
Hold your tongue!
Please stand up.
Tom is still alive.
Words failed her.
